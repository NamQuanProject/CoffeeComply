This agreement establishes a framework for mutual trade liberation, aiming to create a free trade area by dismantling tariffs by September 2020, although some tariffs remain in place. The EU is Algeria's most significant trade partner, responsible for approximately 50% of Algeria's international trade in 2023, with bilateral trade in goods valued at €50.2 billion. The EU mainly imports mineral products from Algeria and exports machinery, chemicals, and transport equipment. Additionally, the bilateral trade in services amounted to €3.7 billion in 2022. The EU-Algeria trade relationship is supported by the EU’s political and financial assistance, as part of the broader European Neighbourhood Policy framework, which includes economic diversification efforts and sustainable development initiatives.\n\nAlgeria is a key partner in the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood initiative, which was established to promote peace, stability, and economic development within Mediterranean countries. The EU has replaced its Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) system with preferential market access under the Association Agreement for countries like Algeria. In recent years, the EU and Algeria have strengthened their partnership priorities, integrating economic, energy, and environmental goals alongside political dialogue. The EU also engages with Algeria through the pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation system to harmonize rules of origin across several regional trading partners, facilitating trade and economic integration.\n\nDespite these efforts, trade tensions arise occasionally, as shown by the EU’s recent dispute settlement case against Algeria over restrictions on EU exports and investments. Measures to protect against unfair trading practices remain a central element of the EU’s trade strategy, alongside ongoing dialogues to refine trade protocols and maximize mutual benefits.",

The trade agreement facilitates the opening of markets on both sides, enhancing the stability and predictability of trade and investment activities. Bolivia, another member of the Andean Community, is eligible to apply for accession to this agreement.\n\nThe EU is the Andean countries' third-largest trade partner, recording a trade volume of approximately €33 billion in 2023. The Andean Community's exports to the EU primarily consist of agricultural products, mineral products, and fisheries, while the EU exports manufactured goods such as machinery and chemical products to the Andean countries.\n\nImportantly, the trade agreement includes provisions that aim to improve market access for goods and services, foster fair competition, protect intellectual property rights, and facilitate dispute resolution. Furthermore, it comprises a Trade and Sustainable Development chapter, which emphasizes high levels of labor and environmental protection.\n\nThrough the EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP), Bolivia enjoys preferential market access, further supported by specific incentives for sustainable development under the GSP+ program.\n\nRegular interaction through committees and dialogues ensures the effective implementation of the agreement, providing platforms for discussion on trade issues and best practices.\n\nThe agreement has tangible benefits, as evidenced by success stories like Austria's Freywille jeweller, which has expanded in Colombia, partly driven by the 2013 EU trade deal with Colombia.

These programs provide varying levels of preferential market access to EU nations. While Tajikistan is a standard GSP beneficiary, the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan have graduated to GSP+ status, allowing for even more advantageous trading terms. However, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, due to their higher economic status, no longer qualify for these schemes.\n\nCentral Asian countries also engage in broader trade frameworks, with Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic being members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). Uzbekistan holds observer status in the EAEU. Kazakhstan was the first among them to sign an Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA) with the EU, effective from March 2020.

This includes an interim Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) signed at the end of 2007 by six ESA countries, namely Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. \n\nUnder this agreement, these countries benefit from the elimination of EU duties and quotas on their imports, while the EU progressively opens up markets for its exports to these nations. The agreement outlines rules of origin, provisions on fisheries, trade defence mechanisms, and development cooperation, as well as includes dialogue on technical barriers to trade and animal and plant health standards. Additionally, there is a rendez-vous clause aiming to expand negotiations towards services, investment, sustainable development, and competition—referred to as the \"deepening\" process.\n\nThe EU is actively engaging with the ESA countries to deepen this EPA, a process that began on 2 October 2019. In terms of trade dynamics, ESA exports to the EU mainly consist of sugar, coffee, fish, tobacco, copper, and crude oil, while imports from the EU are largely machinery, vehicles, and pharmaceutical products.\n\nIn January 2020, an amendment to the rules on the Protocol on Rules of Origin was accepted. This aims to simplify and enhance trade flexibility and cost efficiency between the ESA region and the EU. Both parties continue to cooperate through regular meetings, discussing best practices and ensuring the functionality of the agreement. Through these established trade relations, the EU seeks to foster economic growth and partnership effectiveness in the ESA region, with efforts acknowledged in recent European Commission reports highlighting progressive negotiations.",

The EU is by far the main trading partner of the Faroe Islands, involved in nearly 37% of their total trade in goods in 2023. The European Union imports a substantial portion of fishery products from the Faroes, while the islands receive various manufactured products from the EU—illustrating a trade balance largely characterized by the exchange of fish for manufactured goods. \n\nDespite their close trade ties, the Faroe Islands are not part of the EU, nor a member of the European Economic Area like some of its Nordic neighbors. Instead, their affiliation is marked by autonomy within the Kingdom of Denmark and a series of bilateral agreements with the EU addressing fisheries, trade in goods, and technological cooperation. In 2024, a Memorandum of Understanding was established to foster enhanced cooperation, covering shared principles and jointly addressing issues such as democracy, sustainable development, and international law. \n\nTo ensure smooth operations under the Free Trade Agreement, a Joint Committee meets regularly to tackle relevant issues. The EU applies specific rules and requirements for trade with the Faroes, particularly involving food safety and plant health, and controls applicable defense measures in imports as part of its trade structure.

Despite this, trade engagements are influenced by international sanctions, especially concerning nuclear programs and regional security issues. In 2022, Iran held the position of the 64th biggest trade partner with the EU, amounting to a total trade volume of €5.2 billion, dominated by the EU's exports of machinery and chemicals and imports of plastics, rubber, and vegetable products.

The agreement encapsulates a comprehensive trade aspect covering key areas such as tariffs, rules of origin, technical barriers, sanitary and phytosanitary standards, government procurement, intellectual property, sustainable development, and SME support. This agreement reflects efforts to cement a robust economic and political relationship between the regions.\n\nMercosur, founded in 1991, has evolved its trade dynamics, where the EU ranks as its second-largest trading partner after China. In 2023, EU-Mercosur trade reached over €109 billion in goods, with EU exports composed primarily of machinery, chemicals, and transport equipment. Conversely, Mercosur's exports to the EU were dominated by mineral products and foodstuffs. The commercial exchanges also extend to services, where the EU remarkably exported €28.2 billion in 2022.\n\nThe trade relationship has further matured with significant EU investments in Mercosur, culminating in €384.7 billion in 2022. Despite Mercosur countries losing eligibility for the EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences due to their economic status, this partnership remains vital for mutual economic growth and sustainable development.\n\nThe agreement is pending adoption or ratification by member states.

EU institutions draft laws pertinent to trade and negotiate international trade agreements on behalf of its members. The scope of the EU's authority includes goods, services, intellectual property rights (e.g., patents), public procurement, and foreign direct investment. Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union outlines the framework governing EU trade policy.\n\nThe EU adopted a new trade strategy on 18 February 2021, termed 'Open Strategic Autonomy', emphasizing openness, sustainability, and assertiveness to boost economic recovery and support shifts towards green and digital transformations. A key aspect of this strategy is augmenting multilateralism and reshaping global trade regulations to advance fairness and sustainability.\n\nEU trade negotiations aim to create economic growth and employment by enabling European businesses to access foreign markets at reduced costs and enhanced competitiveness. Such agreements allow for easier access to raw materials and improve the capacity of European firms to export and partake in the global market. By consolidating EU-wide efforts, countries leverage collective economic influence to secure favorable trade terms, also promoting EU values like human rights and environmental standards globally.\n\nNegotiation procedures involve the European Commission receiving a mandate from the Council of the EU, undertaking negotiations, maintaining close communication with the European Parliament and civil society, and publishing relevant documents like position papers and negotiating outcomes. Negotiations cover the reduction of tariffs, removal of export restrictions, and ensuring fair competition while adhering to health and safety standards.\n\nTrade agreements, once completed, undergo scrutiny by both the European Parliament and the Council, and may require ratification by individual EU member states if they address shared responsibilities. Before full ratification, agreements may be provisionally applied with the Council’s approval, conditional on the European Parliament's consent.\n\nThe European Commission also continually updates EU trade policy through legal instruments such as delegated and implementing acts, realigning strategies to accommodate evolving global trade dynamics.",

Initiated by the UNCTAD over 50 years ago, GSP aims to integrate these countries into the global economy by alleviating poverty and fostering job creation while upholding international standards in labor and human rights, environmental conservation, and governance.\n\nThe EU's GSP is notably progressive, offering three types of arrangements: Standard GSP for low and lower-middle-income nations, GSP+ which provides zero tariffs for countries adhering to 27 international conventions, and the Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme for least developed countries (LDCs), granting duty-free, quota-free market access for all goods except arms and ammunition.\n\nDeveloping countries qualify for GSP automatically if classified below upper-middle income by the World Bank and not part of another preferential arrangement. Additionally, GSP+ requires countries to implement international conventions on human rights and good governance. The EU continuously monitors compliance, with reports published biennially. The scheme's impacts, with evidence of increased trade volumes from beneficiary countries and LDCs reported, indicate a successful integration effort into global markets.\n\nA GSP review prompted a legislative proposal for a new 2024-2034 scheme to adapt to the challenges faced by GSP countries while maintaining a focus on social and environmental issues. An amendment extending current rules to 2027 has been signed, pending adoption of a new regulation.\n\nStakeholder engagement includes regular reports to EU bodies, industry safeguards, and civil society dialogue.

These agreements aim to address 'behind-the-border issues' such as technical, social, and environmental aspects to ensure trade policy assists in the sustainable development of partner countries.\n\nA key component of the EU strategy is the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) which focuses on providing unilateral trade preferences to developing countries. The scheme, implemented since 2014, targets sectors where these countries need the most assistance.\n\nAdditionally, the EU's \"Aid for Trade\" initiative provides support for the infrastructural, agricultural, and service-related needs of poor nations to build their trade capabilities and reduce poverty.

However, these benefits can be revoked if there are serious violations of human rights. The GSP+ initiative offers even greater market access contingent on adherence to 27 international human and labor rights conventions, subject to withdrawal if these conventions are not respected. Modern EU trade agreements specifically require respect for International Labour Organization conventions addressing freedom of association, forced labor, child labor, and workplace discrimination. The EU also enforces strict controls on exports that could be used for torture or capital punishment and regulates dual-use goods to prevent human rights abuses related to digital surveillance. Ongoing updates on these policies and initiatives include sustainability impact assessments, compliance support facilities, and partnerships focused on critical mineral supply chains.

Moreover, the EU's modern policy approach is also reflected in its efforts to update the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) to align with current practices. The EU has additionally regulated the financial responsibilities arising from investor-state disputes, distinguishing between EU and Member States' liabilities based on legal contexts. The EU is actively involved in addressing trade disputes as evidenced by its recent involvement in WTO rulings concerning actions taken by the EU in environmental, anti-dumping tariffs on brandy, and the trade dispute over frozen fries with Colombia. The EU continuously hosts stakeholder meetings to discuss the establishment of a Multilateral Investment Court.",
    "https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/enforcement-and-protection/dispute-settlement/investment-disputes_en": "With the enactment of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009, foreign direct investment became part of the European Union's (EU) common commercial policy. Consequently, the EU began negotiations with third countries to develop rules concerning investment protection and liberalization. These negotiations involve the establishment of mechanisms that permit investors to initiate claims against states through independent tribunals in case of breaches of agreements. Since 2015, efforts by the European Commission have been directed towards setting up a Multilateral Investment Court. This initiative aligns with the global presence of approximately 3,000 bilateral investment treaties, with over 1,400 involving EU member states. These treaties commonly include dispute settlement mechanisms for investor protection. EU investors frequently engage with these mechanisms, making them one of the primary users worldwide. The discussion mentions specific investment dispute cases under the Energy Charter Treaty, such as those involving AS PNB BANKA and Nord Stream 2, with documents and developments tracked for these cases.",

    "https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/enforcement-and-protection/dispute-settlement/wto-dispute-settlement_en": "The World Trade Organization (WTO) has a structured legal framework, known as the Understanding on Dispute Settlement, for resolving trade disputes among its members, which occur over the implementation of WTO agreements. Ideally, such disputes should be negotiated and resolved amicably. If negotiations fail, a WTO member can request a panel to settle the dispute. A panel's report can be appealed at the Appellate Body, which consists of seven members that may uphold, modify, or reverse panels’ findings. Non-compliance with these terms may result in actions such as trade compensations or sanctions.\n\nSince December 2019, the Appellate Body, due to a deadlock on new appointments, has been incapacitated in delivering binding resolutions for disputes or providing the right to appellate review. This has led to the EU, among other WTO members, engaging in initiatives to address the impasse. The EU supports negotiations under the WTO General Council led by Ambassador David Walker to amend the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes.\n\nIn response to the Appellate Body crisis, the EU, in collaboration with other WTO members, created a Multi-party interim appeal arbitration arrangement (MPIA) effective from April 2020. This enables participating members to maintain a two-tiered dispute resolution process, with arbitrators to handle appeals. Currently, over 50 WTO members participate in the MPIA.\n\nThe EU also leverages an Enforcement Regulation to act when settlements in WTO or bilateral disputes are blocked, as part of its broader strategy to reform the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism. These reforms aim to restore functionality, improve negotiations for new trade agreements, and enhance transparency in trade practices.\n\nRecent news includes the WTO confirming the EU's climate actions under the Renewable Energy Directive against Indonesia's dispute, EU's challenge against China's anti-dumping tariffs on EU brandy, and further actions regarding Colombia's tariffs on EU frozen fries.\n\nAdditionally, stakeholder meetings about establishing a Multilateral Investment Court have been scheduled, illustrating ongoing dialogues to address trade dispute and investment issues.",

The EU actively engages in these mechanisms to uphold its rights under Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and protect its investors in third countries.\n\nDispute settlement under the WTO provides a structured approach for member countries to resolve disputes related to the implementation of trade agreements. Similarly, the EU's bilateral trade and investment agreements facilitate state-to-state dispute settlement, ensuring that the rights and obligations within these agreements are respected.\n\nThe EU has also been proactive in negotiating investment treaties that protect EU investors in foreign territories. These treaties are crucial for addressing disputes such as expropriation by allowing investors to seek resolutions before independent courts and tribunals. A notable example is the EU's involvement in the Energy Charter Treaty, which provides for such investment dispute settlements.\n\nTo support its dispute resolution activities, the EU maintains a pool of qualified adjudicators, established through a rigorous selection process, to ensure precise adjudication under its trade agreements. Final participant selections for specific rosters or tribunals are made in agreement with the counterpart country after EU Council approval.\n\nRecent notable disputes include the WTO's confirmation of the EU's climate-based actions in a renewable energy dispute with Indonesia and challenges posed by China’s anti-dumping tariffs on EU brandy.

It facilitates cooperation among Member States and the European Commission through a mechanism allowing them to exchange information on investment transactions that might pose risks. The Commission can issue opinions on investments affecting multiple Member States or strategic EU projects. The regulation also stipulates that Member States wishing to retain or create national screening mechanisms must adhere to standards including transparency, non-discrimination, and confidentiality.\n\nFurther updates to the regulation, proposed in January 2024, seek to enhance the efficiency of the framework. These changes include requiring all Member States to implement a screening mechanism with harmonized rules, and extending screening to EU investors controlled by non-EU entities. A Joint Controllership Arrangement governs data protection during the investment screening processes, ensuring compliance with GDPR and related laws. Additionally, the regulation fosters international cooperation on investment screening, particularly with like-minded countries such as the US, and encourages the EU to engage in dialogues within platforms like the OECD and the Trade and Technology Council.\n\nAnnual reports are published to provide insights into the regulation's implementation, noting trends, legal developments, and activities within the EU's cooperative framework.

The Court will have a first instance tribunal and an appellate tribunal staffed by tenured judges adhering to strict ethical standards. It will also feature a dedicated secretariat to manage operations. Importantly, the Court will only handle disputes under treaties that explicitly permit such proceedings, ensuring it does not create new avenues for investors to sue states.\n\nThis initiative follows the EU's direction in its Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), such as CETA and the EU-Vietnam FTA, and is part of a broader strategy to modernize and unify the global investment dispute framework. The need for such a court arises from the EU's position as a leading exporter and importer of foreign investments, necessitating reliable and ethical dispute resolutions.\n\nDespite over 3,200 existing international investment agreements, many do not align with the reforms the EU has been championing. The Multilateral Investment Court seeks to replace older dispute settlement mechanisms. The European Union has been actively pursuing the establishment of this court and has conducted various public consultations and impact assessments to explore its feasibility.

Economic coercion involves pressures from a third country to influence the EU or its Member States' decisions via trade or investment measures. The regulation provides a structured framework for detection, evaluation, and response to such coercion, adhering to international law.\n\nThe process begins with the European Commission's examination of alleged coercive actions based on requests or its own volition, concluding typically within four months. The Commission then proposes a determination, which the EU Council reviews, to officially recognize the acts as coercion within 8 to 10 weeks. Subsequently, the EU may engage the responsible third country in dialogue aimed at resolving the issue diplomatically.\n\nIf diplomatic measures fail, the EU can deploy countermeasures that might restrict the third country's market access, affect trade in goods and services, or impact investments, aiming to counteract the coercion. The selection of measures involves stakeholder consultations and aims to be context-appropriate. The Anti-Coercion Instrument is part of broader international cooperation efforts, including discussions in forums like the G7, to address coercive economic actions communal being international challenges. Stakeholders can engage through a designated contact point.

A significant part of this strategy involves supporting global health initiatives, such as the United Nations High Level Panel on Access to Medicines, and funding projects to bolster public health systems and pharmaceutical quality in African ACP countries. The EU is the third-largest public funder of medicine R&D, especially for diseases affecting impoverished areas, having invested €905 million between 2007 and 2013, and €365 million from 2014 to 2015.\n\nA key policy in facilitating access to medicines is the elimination of tariffs on these products, which would otherwise increase their cost. Additionally, EU legislation encourages pharmaceutical companies to apply tiered pricing strategies that reduce medicine costs in poorer regions. The effectiveness of these measures was reviewed in 2016 and found to contribute positively, though modestly, in stimulating these pricing policies as part of a broader strategy targeting major diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.\n\nCouncil Regulation (EC) 953/2003 plays a role by ensuring certain key medicines are not diverted from intended markets under tiered pricing agreements.

IPRs serve to protect and encourage the creation and distribution of innovations, trademarks, designs, and other intangible assets, which are vital for smaller enterprises to compete with more established firms. The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) has conducted studies that highlight the contribution of IPRs to the EU economy.\n\nIPRs provide several advantages such as enabling indirect revenue through licensing, preserving cultural diversity by supporting creators in industries like publishing and music, and facilitating the dissemination of technical knowledge through patents. Patents, in particular, are highlighted as a key element for technological information, avoiding redundant R&D efforts, and fostering technology transfers. Intellectual property also plays a crucial role in accessing finance as it can serve as collateral. Additionally, robust IPR enforcement protects consumers from counterfeit products, ensuring safety and quality standards.\n\nThe latest news related to IPRs includes actions by the EU against China at the WTO over royalty disputes in high-tech sectors, highlighting issues in intellectual property enforcement in third countries, and the publication of the Counterfeit and Piracy Watch List, which identifies problematic areas outside the EU.",

In the European Union (EU), GIs are a significant area within their trade policy framework, focusing on enhancing protection and enforcing these indications on an international scale.\n\nThe EU's approach at the multilateral level involves active participation in the World Trade Organization (WTO), which extended the reach of GI protection significantly since their inclusion in the 1994 agreement under intellectual property. Currently, the EU supports negotiations within the WTO’s Doha Development Agenda to better protect GIs broadly, including the creation of an international registry for GIs and proposing broader product protection similar to that already afforded to wines and spirits.\n\nBilateral strategies often incorporate GI protections within Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) or standalone agreements, aiming to achieve protection levels in partner territories comparable to the EU. These agreements typically include robust enforcement measures, lists of protected GIs, and ensure that administrative measures are in place alongside judicial ones.\n\nWithin the EU, two civil dialogue groups advise on geographical indications related to quality promotion and international agricultural aspects.

The investigation aims to determine whether dumping is occurring, if it is causing material injury to the EU industry, and whether imposing anti-dumping duties aligns with the EU's economic interests. The investigation begins upon receiving a valid complaint from an EU industry, and within 45 days, a Notice of Initiation is published detailing the investigation scope. The Commission distributes questionnaires to exporters, EU producers, importers, and users to gather data for analysis. Upon collecting and verifying responses, the Commission may impose provisional duties, pursue further investigation, or terminate proceedings. Comments from interested parties are considered throughout, and definitive measures must be decided within 14 months of initiating the investigation.

Importers subject to anti-dumping duties can apply for a refund of these duties when they can demonstrate that the situation prompting the duty has changed - specifically, if the dumping margin of the product in question has been reduced or eliminated, thereby warranting a reassessment of the imposed duty level.\n\nRefund applications must be directed to the relevant national authorities in the EU member state where the duties were originally paid. These authorities will forward the request to the European Commission for a thorough investigation. Importers are required to provide compelling evidence and detailed documentation justifying their refund claim. Cooperation from the exporting producer is crucial in this process as it involves verifying changes to the dumping margin.\n\nNational authorities retain exclusive jurisdiction over other types of reimbursement requests, such as situations where the importer argues that the duties were unjustified from the start. \n\nFor practical assistance, the European Commission provides guidelines on the refund application process, a checklist for preparing applications, a template for listing relevant import transactions, and contact details of national points of contact. The commission also communicates ongoing trade defence activities and policy adaptations through news updates, such as recent measures against dumped goods like MSG and safeguard adjustments in the steel industry.\n\nThe European Commission holds regular Civil Society Dialogue meetings on trade defence instruments.

An interim review can be either 'full' or 'partial', addressing aspects such as the level of dumping, injury to the community, and community interest. Requests for review must be substantiated with sufficient evidence illustrating changes that justify reevaluation, such as altered cost structures leading to reduced dumping.\n\n**New Exporter Reviews:**\nThese are for companies that did not export during the original investigation but have since started exporting to the EU. Companies meeting specific criteria can have their individual duty rate assessed instead of being subjected to a generic country-wide duty.\n\n**Absorption and Anti-Absorption Reinvestigations:**\nThis addresses cases where imposed duties have not led to anticipated price changes due to internal absorption practices. When absorption is suspected, a re-investigation can be initiated to reassess the situation, potentially leading to increased duties.\n\n**Circumvention of Measures:**\nCircumvention involves tactics employed to avoid duty payments, such as minor product modifications or rerouting through third-party countries. If circumvention is detected, duties can be retrospectively imposed and measures extended to prevent such practices.\n\n**Expiry Reviews:**\nConducted to determine whether existing measures should be extended beyond the initial five years. These reviews assess whether the cessation of measures would likely lead to resumed dumping and injury.\n\n**Regulatory Updates and Structural Changes:**\nThe document advises companies undergoing structural changes to immediately report to the EU to avoid customs issues, as misalignment between regulation and documentation can lead to complications.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\nThe EU has recently extended various anti-dumping and trade protection measures, such as those on MSG imports from China now covering Malaysian imports and heightened protections for the steel industry.\n\n**Events:**\nThe document also provides information on recent and upcoming meetings related to the EU’s trade defense instruments.",

These duties are calculated based on the dumping margin, unless a smaller duty would suffice to alleviate the harm. There are three main forms of anti-dumping duties: \\n1. **Ad Valorem Duty** - a percentage of the product's value on a CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) basis. \\n2. **Specific Duty** - a fixed amount for a volume of goods, such as €100 per tonne. \\n3. **Variable Duty** - importers avoid these duties if the import price is above a set Minimum Import Price (MIP). \\nExporters might offer price undertakings, committing to uphold MIPs, which would exempt them from these duties. These commitments are governed by EU and WTO regulations, notably Article 8, and are not publicly disclosed to prevent market distortion.\\nThe European Commission frequently monitors these undertakings and adapts measures based on the market situation. Notably, the EU has recently extended anti-dumping measures for MSG imports from Malaysia and strengthened safeguards for its steel industry. The Commission is also proactively tracking the imports of key industrial chemicals to protect local industries.

The European Commission is responsible for investigating these dumping allegations and taking actions when necessary. Investigations are initiated either through formal complaints by EU producers or, in some cases, initiated by the Commission itself ('ex officio').\n\nThe investigation process involves determining if dumping is occurring, if it causes material injury to the EU industry, if there's a causal link between them, and whether imposing measures serves the EU's interest. Since December 2017, the EU employs an alternative calculation of dumping where state distortions in the exporting country are significant.\n\nAnti-dumping measures usually last five years, subject to reviews if necessary, and are often executed through ad valorem duties, fixed duties, or minimum import prices. Importers may seek refunds if duties exceed the actual dumping margin. The European Commission is actively involved in monitoring and enforcing these measures to ensure compliance and address unfair trade practices effectively.\n\nRecent actions include extending measures on monosodium glutamate from China and Malaysia, strengthening the steel industry’s protections, and tracking volumes of chemical imports like ethylene and ammonia.

A refund refers to a process where importers of products subject to countervailing duties can request a return of the duties paid if they can demonstrate that the amount of subsidies justifying these duties has been reduced or eliminated. Importers are required to submit their refund requests to the authorities of the EU country where the duties were initially paid. These authorities will then forward the request to the European Commission for investigation.\n\nTo submit a refund application, the importer must provide reasons and evidence supporting the claim that the subsidy margin has been reduced or eliminated. Furthermore, the process mandates cooperation from the exporting producer. Guidelines, checklists, contact points, and a list of necessary documents like import transaction templates are provided to facilitate the application.\n\nThe document also details recent episodes of podcasts discussing trade policy, as well as news items about actions and adjustments in trade measures, such as anti-dumping extensions on monosodium glutamate and the strengthening of steel safeguard measures.

Key concepts include anti-subsidy measures, interim reviews, new exporter reviews, anti-absorption re-investigations, circumvention, expiration reviews, and procedural adjustments for companies undergoing structural changes. \n\nAn interim review examines changes in circumstances justifying modifications in existing countervailing measures, which are typically imposed for five years. Interim reviews can be initiated by the EU Commission or relevant parties a year after measures commence, encompassing subsidization, injury, and Community interest factors.\n\nA new exporter review allows companies not involved in the original investigation to obtain individual duty rates if established post-investigation.\n\nAnti-absorption re-investigations occur when duties fail to adjust prices appropriately despite the imposition of tariffs. This process can result in recalculated dumping margins.\n\nCircumvention involves actions to avoid duties, prompting the EU to extend duties if detected. Investigations can be retroactively applied.\n\nExpiration or expiry reviews assess ongoing necessity for measures nearing their five-year mark, ensuring continued protection against subsidization and injury.\n\nAdditionally, procedural guidance is offered for companies changing their legal status or name to maintain duty applicability.\n\nThe text also references podcast episodes and news updates discussing trade policy developments, such as reinforcement of anti-dumping measures on MSG imports and monitoring of chemical imports impacting EU markets.",
    "https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/enforcement-and-protection/trade-defence/anti-subsidy-measures_en": "The text provides an overview of the European Union's (EU) policies and procedures related to anti-subsidy measures. Subsidies are financial contributions provided by governments or public bodies, conferring a benefit to the recipient. While some subsidies are designed to support domestic policies such as job creation, others can create unfair competition and distort the EU market. In response, the EU imposes countervailing duties to offset these impacts, provided the subsidies are specific to certain firms or industries, or are export-oriented.\n\nThe EU maintains a database of all subsidies under investigation, and the official regulations are published in the Official Journal of the European Union. Subsidies can take various forms, such as direct financial transfers, tax incentives, and government-facilitated provision of goods and services. Those deemed 'specific' are targeted at limited sectors, like ceramics or chemicals, as opposed to generalized financial support for small businesses across various industries.\n\nEU industries that believe they are affected by subsidized imports can lodge a complaint with the European Commission. The Commission then assesses if there's sufficient evidence of subsidy and resulting injury to initiate an anti-subsidy investigation. In certain cases, the Commission can start investigations independently. A typical investigation checks for the presence of countervailable subsidies, resulting material injury to EU industries, and whether implementing measures serves the EU's broader interest.\n\nOnce determined, countervailing measures can include price surcharges, minimum price requirements, or voluntary export restraints by exporters (price undertakings). These measures typically last five years but can undergo interim reviews if the necessity of continuation is questionable, while expiry reviews can extend them beyond their initial term. Importers may request refunds of duties if subsidies are reduced or eliminated.\n\nRegulation (EU) 2016/1037, amended in 2017, outlines the framework for protection against subsidized imports, underpinned by a 1994 WTO agreement that sanctions trade remedies against unfair subsidies. Recent EU news highlights examples of these measures, including duties on electric bicycles and electric vehicles from China, reflecting ongoing trade negotiations and enforcement actions.",
