        "description": "Country or region\nAlgeria\nTrade topics\nNegotiations and agreements\nTrade policy\nThe EU-Algeria\nAssociation Agreement\nwas signed in April 2002 and entered into force in September 2005.\nThe agreement sets out a framework for the EU-Algeria relationship in all areas, including trade. It reciprocally liberalises trade in goods, with elements of asymmetry in favour of Algeria.\nIt aimed to establish an EU-Algeria free trade area, including the complete dismantling of tariffs, by September 2020 – a target that has been met, save for a few remaining tariffs that Algeria is yet to eliminate.\nTrade picture\nAlgeria is the EU's 22\nnd\nbiggest trade partner, representing 1% of the EU’s total trade in goods in 2023.\nThe EU is Algeria's biggest trade partner and accounts for the majority of Algeria’s international trade (around 50% in 2023).\nTotal trade in goods between the EU and Algeria in 2023 amounted to €50.2 billion. The EU’s imports from Algeria amounted to €35.4 billion. Imports were dominated by mineral products (€33.9 billion, 96%). The EU’s exports to Algeria amounted to €14.9 billion and were dominated by machinery and appliances (€2.7 billion, 18.1%), closely followed by chemicals (€2.5 billion, 16.9%), and transport equipment (€2.2 billion, 15.2%).\nTwo-way trade in services amounted to €3.7 billion in 2022. EU imports of services represented €1.4 billion, and exports were worth €2.3 billion.\nThe EU and Algeria\nThe Free Trade Area (FTA) of the EU-Algeria Association Agreement grants preferential treatment for Algerian exports to the EU. In January 2014, the EU implemented changes to its\nGeneralised Scheme of Preferences\n(GSP), which removes import duties from products coming into the EU from some developing countries. As a result, countries that already had preferential market access to the EU, like Algeria due to its FTA, stopped benefiting from the GSP treatment in 2014.\nThe EU and Algeria adopted on 13 March 2017 new\nPartnership Priorities\nin the framework of the renewed\nEuropean Neighbourhood Policy\n. Together with the\njoint assessment of the implementation of the Association Agreement\n, also adopted in March 2017, they constituted the political framework that guided the dialogue of the EU and its Member States with Algeria until 2020. These Partnership Priorities in the context of EU-Algeria relations focused on a variety of areas, including trade and access to the EU single market, energy, the environment and sustainable development.\nBilateral trade between the two partners is primarily based on Algerian exports of oil and gas products. Algeria is the EU’s third largest supplier of natural gas, after Russia and Norway. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, gas imports from Russia to the EU have fallen significantly. This has primariliy been compensated for by a sharp increase in imports of liquified natural gas (LNG), particularly from the United States, but also via increased gas imports from Algeria and Norway.\nIn 2021, under the new\nEU Trade Policy Review\n, the EU has proposed a new sustainable investment initiative to interested partners in Africa and the Southern Neighbourhood. Fostering strategic interdependencies and enhancing the EU’s relations and economic integration with the Southern Neighbourhood is a strategic necessity for long-term stability.\nFinancial support\nThe European Neighbourhood Policy provides political and financial assistance to Algeria. The EU committed €125 million to bilateral assistance for Algeria for the period 2018-2020, under the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI). The funding supported cooperation priorities agreed with Algeria, namely: (i) economic governance and support for economic diversification; (ii) territorial development and participatory democracy; (iii) energy/environment and climate actions.\nUnder the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2021-2027, the EU will adopt a broad new financial cooperation instrument: the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI). The NDICI is the basis of EU-Algeria cooperation.\nMore information on EU support is available from the\nDirectorate-General for the European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations\n(DG NEAR).\nAlgeria in the Southern Neighbourhood\nAlgeria is one of the partners of the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine*, Syria and Tunisia). The EU established its privileged partnership with the Eastern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean back in 1995 with the launch of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership at the Barcelona Conference, aiming to establish an area of peace, stability and economic prosperity that upholds democratic values and human rights.\nThe 25th anniversary of the Barcelona Process in November 2020 was an opportunity to reflect on the strategic partnership with the region in light of the political, socioeconomic, financial and environmental challenges exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and to reassess the EU’s partnership with Algeria and the other Southern Neighbourhood partner countries. Following consultations with partners, this reflection resulted in the Joint Communication by the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on ‘\nA renewed partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood - A new Agenda for the Mediterranean\n‘ and the annexed '\nEconomic and Investment Plan for the Southern Neighbours\n' in February 2021.\nMore information on the Southern Neighbourhood\nThe impact of trade component of the EU’s Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Algeria was assessed in the\nEx-Post Evaluation of Trade Chapters of the Six Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements\nwith the EU’s Southern Neighbours, published by the Commission in 2021.\nAccording to IMF and World Bank estimates, the Algerian government’s economic diversification plan, if linked to the creation of favourable conditions for the private sector and necessary adjustments to the education and training system, would boost economic growth substantially in the medium term, balancing the short-term costs of transition. Algeria would then be in a position to gain in competitiveness and to benefit from new markets, such as via the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation and the PEM Convention on rules of origin\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation system of origin was created in 2005. It brings together the EU, Algeria and other partners in Europe and the Mediterranean to support regional integration by creating a common system of rules of origin. Rules of origin are technical criteria which determine whether a specific product qualifies for duty-free or other preferential access under a given trade agreement.\nCumulation of origin means that a product coming from one partner country can be processed or added to a product of a second partner country and still be considered as an ‘originating product’ of that second partner country for the purposes of a particular trade agreement.\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean system allows for diagonal cumulation (i.e. cumulation between two or more countries) between the EU, EFTA countries, Türkiye, the Western Balkans, the Faroe Islands, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and any other country that signed the Barcelona Declaration of 1995. The system was originally based on a network of Free Trade Agreements with identical origin protocols.\nThese individual origin protocols are being progressively replaced by a reference to the\nRegional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin\n(PEM Convention), which was\nestablished in 2011\nto provide a more unified framework for origin protocols. Algeria joined the Regional Convention in March 2017.\nCommittees and Dialogues\nThe EU and Algeria meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the Agreement.\nTechnical committee meetings - agendas and reports\nTrading with Algeria\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Algeria\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Algeria\nExporting from the EU\nto Algeria\nTrade defence measures in force in Algeria\nTrade relations are part of\nthe EU's overall political and economic relations with Algeria\nAlgeria is a\nmember of the World Trade Organization\nMore information about\nEU co-operation programmes for Algeria\n* This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue.\nExporters' stories\nLatest news\nNews article\n14 June 2024\nEU begins dispute settlement proceedings against Algeria to defend European companies\nToday, the EU has launched a dispute settlement case against Algeria and requested consultations with Algerian authorities to address several restrictions imposed on EU exports and investments.\n1 min read\nPress release\n30 August 2021\nAn assertive trade policy: EU’s defence measures against unfair trade practices remained effective in 2020\nThe system for protecting EU businesses from dumped and subsidised imports continued to function well in 2020 thanks to the EU’s robust and innovative ways of using trade defence instruments (TDI).\n1 min read\nAll the latest news on EU trade\nShare this page",

Argentina has been involved in the negotiation of the\nEU-Mercosur Association Agreement\n.\nTrade picture\nArgentina is an upper middle-income country and is the third largest economy of Latin America and a G20 member.\nArgentina is a major producer of agricultural commodities and is among the top world exporters of soy and sunflower products, pears, and lemons. Wine and beef are also well-known products, mostly consumed domestically. Argentina also has important mineral resources such as gold, copper and lithium and respectively the 2nd and the 4th largest shale gas and shale oil reserves in the world. Additionally, it has industrial production in sectors such as  cars, nuclear industry, and an emerging digital service sector.\nThe EU is Argentina's third trading partner (after Brazil and China), accounting for 14.1% of total Argentinean trade in 2019. In 2019, EU-Argentina bilateral trade in goods totalled € 14.3 billion.\nArgentina’s main exports to the EU are agricultural products (58%), [petroleum-derived] chemicals (15%) and non-fuel raw materials (12%) (2019 data).\nThe EU exports to Argentina mainly manufactured goods, such as machinery and transport equipment (44%) and chemical products, including pharmaceuticals, (24%) (2019 data).\nIn 2019, the value of EU exports of goods to Argentina was practically the same as that of EU imports from Argentina.\nTrade in services was rather stable between 2016 and 2018. In 2018, the EU imported services from Argentina of a value of €2.2 billion, while it exported services worth €5.3 billion.\nThe EU and Argentina\nThe EU’s historically strong relationship with Argentina is reflected in the level of Foreign Direct Investment by EU companies, which held stocks worth €43 billion in Argentina in 2018.\nThe EU holds bilateral dialogues with Argentina on economic and trade matters through the EU-Argentina Joint Committee, established under the EU-Argentina Framework Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The last such meeting was held in 2017.\nOver several decades, Argentina has imposed significant barriers on imports, exports and capital flows. As a result, international trade and investment climate suffered significantly. Although EU companies and investors reported some improvements in administrative procedures during recent years, a number of significant problems remain, which the EU continues to monitor and take up in bilateral contacts with Argentina. Those problems include in particular:\nExport duties for many products and services ; the tax rate ranges from 5% (including services) to 33% (soy exports),\nNon-automatic import licences applied to around 1500 tariff lines, affecting almost 26% of EU exports to Argentina,\nMandatory preferences for local companies in public procurement\nlocal content requirements in the car and car-part sector  to obtain tax advantages,\nProblems in the protection and enforcement of Intellectual Property rights, including delays in patent proceedings and inadequate protection of geographical indications.\nFor more details,\nsearch for trade barriers on the Access2Markets portal\n.\nArgentina in Mercosur\nMercosur is an economic and political agreement between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.

Negotiations for a region-to-region trade and investment agreement between the EU and ASEAN were launched in 2007 and paused by mutual agreement in 2009 to give way to a bilateral format of negotiations.\nThese bilateral trade and investment agreements were conceived as building blocks towards a future region-to-region agreement.\nNegotiations with Singapore and Malaysia were launched in 2010, with Vietnam in June 2012, with Thailand in March 2013, with the Philippines in December 2015 and with Indonesia in July 2016.\nSo far, the EU has completed negotiations for bilateral agreements with two of them (Singapore in 2014 and Vietnam in 2015), while negotiations with Malaysia and the Philippines are currently on hold.\nNegotiations with Indonesia are ongoing and negotiations with Thailand resumed recently, with the goal of further deepening bilateral trade and investment relations with both countries.

This agreement provides broad scope for cooperation, extending to trade and economic development, human rights, good governance and the environment.\nBangladesh has been a WTO member since 1995 and, as a least developed country, benefits from the EU's 'Everything but Arms' arrangement, which grants duty-free, quota-free access for all exports, except arms and ammunition.\nTrade picture\nThe EU is Bangladesh's main trading partner, accounting for 20.7% of Bangladesh's total trade in 2023.\nIn 2023, Bangladesh was the EU's 36\nth\nlargest trading partner in goods (accounting for 0.4% of the EU's total trade).\nEU imports from Bangladesh are dominated by clothing, accounting for over 90% of the EU's total imports from Bangladesh.\nIn 2023, EU exports to Bangladesh were dominated by machinery and chemical products.\nBangladesh is the largest beneficiary under the EU's Everything But Arms (EBA) arrangements.\nThe EU and Bangladesh\nAs a Least Developed Country (LDC), Bangladesh benefits from the most favourable regime available under the EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP), namely the Everything But Arms (EBA) arrangement. EBA grants the 46 LDCs – including Bangladesh – duty-free, quota-free access to the EU for exports of all products, except arms and ammunition.\nIn July 2013, in response to the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory complex which killed scores of workers, the EU took the initiative of launching a\nSustainability Compact for Bangladesh\nwith the aim of improving labour rights and factory safety in the ready-made garment industry. The initiative brings together the EU, the Government of Bangladesh, the USA, Canada – i.e. the main markets for Bangladeshi garment production – as well as the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The Compact is based on three inter-linked pillars:\nrespect for labour rights;\nstructural integrity of buildings and occupational safety and health, and;\nresponsible business conduct.\nIn October 2019, the authorities of Bangladesh agreed to develop a roadmap, the National Action Plan (NAP) on the Labour Sector, with timelines for reforms to improve labour rights – notably the alignment of the Bangladesh Labour Act and the Export Processing Zone Labour Act – with the ILO fundamental conventions. The NAP was published by Bangladesh in September 2021.\nTrading with Bangladesh\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Bangladesh\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Bangladesh\nExporting from the EU\nto Bangladesh\nTrade defence measures in force in Bangladesh\nTrade relations are part of\nthe EU's overall political and economic relations with Bangladesh\nBangladesh is a\nmember of the World Trade Organization\nShare this page",

        "description": "Country or region\nBelarus\nTrade topics\nNegotiations and agreements\nTrade policy\nFollowing Russia's military aggression against Ukraine, the EU has imposed sanctions on Belarus\n.\nEU restrictive measures in response to the crisis in Ukraine\nThe EU has not yet ratified the bilateral Partnership and Cooperation Agreement concluded with Belarus in 1995, due to Belarus' lack of commitment to democracy, and political and civil rights.\nThe bilateral trade and economic relations therefore remain covered by the\nTrade and Cooperation Agreement\nconcluded by the European Community with the Soviet Union in 1989, and subsequently endorsed by Belarus.\nBelarus applied for membership of the WTO in 1993. Its accession process is still ongoing, but has been suspended following Belarus’ involvement in Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine.\nIn June 2007 the EU withdrew its trade preferences to Belarus under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences, in response to Belarus' violations of the core principles of the International Labour Organisation.\nBelarus’ exports to the EU are therefore subject to import tariffs at the standard non-preferential rate. Once Belarus has shown that it respects basic trade union rights, the EU is ready to reverse its decision.\nA Dialogue on Trade was established in October 2016, in order to facilitate exchanges on trade-related matters at experts’ level. The dialogue took place twice a year in July and December up to July 2020. Since then, the dialogue has been suspended, due to the significant deterioration in the human rights, democracy and rule of law situation in Belarus in the run-up, conduct and aftermath of the 9 August 2020 presidential elections, which the EU declared neither free nor fair.\nTrade picture\nPlease note that the following figures reflect the situation in 2021, before recent trade-related sanctions began to have an effect.\nIn 2021, the EU was Belarus' second main trade partner, representing 19.9% of the country's overall trade in goods. Russia was Belarus' first trading partner, with 49.0% of  Belarus' international trade.\nEU-Belarus bilateral trade in goods declined in 2020 by 7.3%, mainly due to the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic. 2021 saw a substantial recovery. Bilateral trade increased by 27.0%, reaching €12.9 billion, although this only represents growth of 13.3% over the past 10 years.\nBelarus' main exports to the EU (before the current sanctions were introduced) were wood (23.2% of total exports), mineral products (21.6%) and base metals (15.3%). The EU’s main exports to Belarus were machinery (31.2% of total exports), chemicals (15.4%) and transport equipment (12.3%).\nThe EU and Belarus\nAlthough trade between the EU and Belarus has grown in recent years, the EU has suspended moves towards closer economic partnership with Belarus until political and civil conditions improve in Belarus.\nThe EU has also introduced an Outward Processing Trade regime for Belarus. This regime provides for additional import quota amounts for textiles and clothing manufacturers within the European Union so they can produce garments in Belarus that will return to the EU after processing.\nBelarus trade restrictions\nIn addition to the sanctions imposed against Belarus, including both import and export restrictions, since 2010 the EU has imposed unilateral import quotas for Belarus covering trade in textile and clothing products. The unilateral quotas replaced the EU-Belarus textile agreement that Belarus no longer wanted to renew after joining the Customs Union with Russia and Kazakhstan.\nCommittees and Dialogues\nAll bilateral dialogue with Belarus is currently suspended.\nTechnical committee meetings - agendas and reports\nTrading with Belarus\nTrade with Belarus is currently heavily restricted by EU sanctions (see news below; 18 March 2022)\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Belarus\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Belarus\nExporting from the EU\nto Belarus\nTrade defence measures in force in Belarus\nTrade relations are part of\nthe EU's overall political and economic relations with Belarus\nLatest news\nNews article\n3 July 2024\nEU protects sanctions against Russian and Belarussian investors under Energy Charter Treaty\nIn the context of Russia’s ongoing unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine, the EU’s decision to deny the ECT’s protection to investments and investors from Russia and Belarus pre-emptively nullifies a potential way to challenge EU sanctions.\n1 min read\nNews article\n18 March 2022\nPractical guidelines on export restrictions to Russia and Belarus published\nToday, the Commission published a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on export-related restrictions concerning dual-use goods and advance technology items.\n1 min read\nNews article\n16 March 2022\nEU adjusts steel safeguard quotas following import bans\nThe EU has today adjusted the import quotas included in the EU’s steel safeguard.\n1 min read\nAll the latest news on EU trade\nShare this page",

        "description": "Country or region\nCentral America\nTrade topics\nNegotiations and agreements\nTrade policy\nThe EU and the Central American region concluded a new\nAssociation Agreement\n, signed on 29 June 2012. The Association Agreement relies on three complementary and equally important pillars: namely political dialogue, cooperation and trade, which reinforce each other and their effects. These are the right tools to support economic growth, democracy and political stability in Central America.\nCentral American countries: Panama, Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua\nThe trade pillar of the Association Agreement has been provisionally applied since 1 August 2013 with Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama, since 1 October 2013 with Costa Rica and El Salvador, and since 1 December 2013 with Guatemala.\nSince then,\nvarious implementing measures or amendments\nto the Association Agreement have been introduced to facilitate its governance.\nTrade picture\nEurostat data show that the trade flow between the EU and Central America amounted to €22 billion in 2023. The EU's trade balance with Central America presented a trade surplus of €4.2 billion in 2023 (the year before, there was a deficit of €1.1 billion). Regarding services, the total volume of trade in services in 2022 was €11.2 billion, with the EU exporting a total of €5.76 billion worth of services. Bilateral trade with Central America was particularly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath from 2020-2021.\nEU exports to Central America increased by 56% in 2023. This increase was mainly driven by a very good performance in exports of: products of the chemical or allied industry, base metals, and machinery & equipment, which grew by 243.3%, 22.9% and 15.6% respectively.\nIn comparison, the main EU imports from Central America by HS section decreased by 5.9%. EU imports are, by order of importance: Vegetable products; Optical and photographic instruments, etc.; Animal or vegetable fats and oils; Machinery and appliances, and; Foodstuffs, beverages and tobacco.\nThe main EU exports to Central America by HS section are, by order of importance: Products of the chemical or allied industries; Machinery and appliances; Mineral products; Foodstuffs, beverages and tobacco; and Transport equipment.\nThe EU and Central America are exchange annually their respective statistics to produce a joint analysis. Given the importance of the Panamanian Trade Free Zone (the second in the world), Eurostat data tends to overestimate EU exports to Central America.\nWe recommend consulting the\nAnnual Report of the Commission\nfor detailed analysis.\nThe EU and Central America\nThe EU and Central America have maintained close and comprehensive relations for decades, dating back to the EU’s support for the region's successful peace process in the 1980s.\nThe EU’s central trade policy objectives for Central America are to increase bilateral trade, and to use it to strengthen the process of regional integration between the countries of the region. In practical terms, this means the creation of a customs union, and economic integration, in Central America. The EU has supported this process through its trade agreement and its trade-related technical cooperation programmes.\nThis new agreement aims at fostering sustainable development and deepening the process of regional integration. Closer economic integration between the countries of the Central American region is important for attracting investment to the region and helping local businesses to develop the strength in their regional market to compete internationally.\nThe trade part of the Association Agreement replaces unilateral preferential access to the EU market, which was granted to Central America under the EU’s\nGeneral Scheme of Preferences\n.\nBenefits of the Agreement\nElimination of most import tariffs;\nimproved access to government procurement, services and investment markets;\nbetter conditions for trade through new disciplines on non-tariff barriers to market access, competition, and intellectual property rights;\na more predictable environment for trade with a mediation mechanism for non-tariff barriers and a bilateral dispute settlement mechanism;\nstrengthening regional integration, for example by setting up a single import duty for the whole region and using a single administrative document for customs, and;\nsupport for sustainable development, including the consultation of civil society stakeholders.\nHighlights of the Agreement\nCommittees and Dialogues\nThe EU and Central America meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the agreement.\nMeetings and documents\nTrading with Central America\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Central America\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Central America\nExporting from the EU\nto Central America\nTrade defence measures in force in Central America\nTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with\nCosta Rica\n,\nEl Salvador\n,\nGuatemala\n,\nHonduras\n,\nNicaragua\nand\nPanama\nCentral America is one of the most\nintegrated regions of the world\n, progressing towards a customs union and with elaborated potential integration mechanisms.\nExporters' stories\nBelgium - New aromas for European coffee drinkers\nAs a result of the EU's trade deals, Belgian coffee maker OR was able to build partnerships with farmers in countries such as Costa Rica.

        "description": "Country or region\nCentral Asia\nTrade topics\nNegotiations and agreements\nTrade policy\nCentral Asia is of geostrategic importance to the EU. The region represents a bridge to China,  Afghanistan and the Middle East. It is a source of significant energy imports for the EU.\nCentral Asia:\nKazakhstan\n, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan\nCentral Asian countries share some common features: they are landlocked, their exports focus on raw materials, and they all face significant influence from neighbouring powers, namely Russia or China. Yet they significantly differ from one another in terms of wealth and trade volumes with the EU. Despite some economic growth in recent years, Central Asian countries remain characterised by a low level of economic diversification and a high dependence on a relatively small number of trade partners.\nThree of the five Central Asian countries (Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan) benefit from favourable access to the EU market, through the\nGeneralised Scheme of Preferences\n(GSP) or GSP+. While Tajikistan meets the standard GSP criteria, the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan have also joined the EU’s GSP+ arrangement, which grants additional preferences. Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, as upper middle income-level economies, can no longer benefit from this scheme.\nTwo Central Asian countries are also members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU): Kazakhstan since 2010 and the Kyrgyz Republic since 2015. Uzbekistan became an EAEU observer in 2020.\nTrade picture\nEU trade with Central Asia has grown and the EU is now the region’s main trade partner, accounting for about a third of its overall external trade. Nevertheless, the total turnover of the EU's trade with Central Asia remains low.\nThe EU is the region's main trading partner, accounting for 23.6% of Central Asian countries' combined foreign trade in 2021. According to preliminary data for 2022, EU goods imports from Central Asia continue to increase (by 67% in 2022) and exports from the EU to Central Asia also grew (by 77%).\nThe EU is also the biggest foreign investor in Central Asia, with over 40% of cumulated investment in the region originating from the bloc.\nNegotiations for non-preferential enhanced bilateral partnership and cooperation frameworks (EPCAs) also support overall cooperation between the EU and Central Asia.\nCentral Asian exports to the EU largely focus on a few commodities, particularly crude oil, gas, metals and cotton fibre.\nEU exports are dominated by machinery and transport equipment, and other manufactured goods. Such products account for more than half of EU exports to the region.\nThe EU and Central Asia\nThe EU adopted a\nNew Central Asia Strategy\nin 2019, which outlines the EU's strategic interests in the region and focuses on three pillars: increased resilience, regional cooperation, and prosperity.\nThe strategy proposes to forge a stronger and non-exclusive partnership with Central Asian countries for resilience and prosperity. It has since been complemented by the Global Gateway Strategy and the European Green Deal, which are also relevant for the EU’s relations with the region. Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine and the ensuing challenge of preventing the circumvention of EU sanctions against Russia, while seeking even deeper and closer trade relations between the EU and Central Asian countries, will have to be handled in parallel.\nThe overall institutional framework for the EU's cooperation with the region is as follows:\nThe EU's bilateral trade relations with Kazakhstan are covered by an\nEnhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement\n(EPCA) signed in Astana on 21 December 2015, which entered into force on 1 March 2020. The agreement constitutes the first of its kind signed by the EU with one of its Central Asian partners. It elevates relations between the EU and Kazakhstan to a new level. In May 2023, the Commission received a mandate from the Council to negotiate a Protocol to the EPCA with Kazakhstan as regards the protection of Geographical Indications (GIs) for agricultural products and foodstuffs, wines and spirits.\nThe EU and Kyrgyzstan initialled an EPCA in 2019 which remains to be concluded and signed. Member States agreed on 29 March 2023 to move forward with the EPCA as a mixed agreement and invited the Commission to present proposals for its signature and conclusion at the earliest possible time (after the Council has defined the scope of provisional application of the agreement).\nThe EPCA with Uzbekistan was initialled in July 2022 and the text is currently being prepared for signature.\nOn the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council on 8 December 2022, negotiations for an EPCA with Tajikistan were launched in February 2023. The first round of negotiations with Tajikistan on the trade title of the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement took place in Dushanbe on 1-2 June 2023.\nDraft texts and negotiating round reports\nA Partnership and Cooperation Agreement concluded with Turkmenistan in 1998 is yet to be ratified by all EU Member States. Pending ratification, an Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters entered into force on 1 August 2010. Other areas of cooperation remain based on the Trade and Cooperation Agreement signed with the Soviet Union in 1989 and subsequently endorsed by Turkmenistan.\nThe EU has concluded an\nEnhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the Kyrgyz Republic\n, which is now pending signature.\nReport on negotiations of the EPCA 2017-2019\nThe EU's Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA) with Uzbekistan was initialled in July 2022. It is currently being prepared for signature.\nDraft texts and negotiating round reports\nWTO membership\nWTO membership of all the Central Asian countries is a pre-condition for closer trade and investment relations with the EU.\nKyrgyzstan has been a WTO member since 1998.\nTajikistan became a WTO member in 2013.\nKazakhstan became a WTO member in 2015.\nIn June 2019, Uzbekistan expressed a renewed commitment to join the WTO in the near future.\nTurkmenistan was granted WTO observer status in 2020.\nCommittees and Dialogues\nThe EU and Central Asia meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the agreement.\nMeetings and documents - Kazakhstan\nMeetings and documents - Kyrgyz Republic\nMeetings and documents - Uzbekistan\nTrading with Central Asia\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Central Asia\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Central Asia\nExporting from the EU\nto Central Asia\nTrade defence measures in force in Central Asia\nTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with\nKazakhstan\n,\nKyrgyz Republic\n,\nTajikistan\nand\nUzbekistan\nLatest news\nNews article\n9 April 2021\nUzbekistan joins EU’s GSP+ arrangement\nThe EU will start applying preferential tariffs for products imported from Uzbekistan under this arrangement from 10 April 2021.\n2 min read\nAll the latest news on EU trade\nShare this page",

        "description": "Country or region\nChina\nTrade topics\nNegotiations and agreements\nTrade policy\nChina is the EU’s second largest trading partner for goods after the United States, with bilateral trade reaching €739 billion in 2023. This represents a decline of 14% compared to 2022. China is the EU's third-largest partner for exports and the biggest for imports. The EU-China trade balance has been persistently in favour of China. In 2023, the EU deficit amounted to €292 billion. EU exports to China amounted to €223.6 billion, whereas EU imports from China amounted to €515.9 billion, indicating year-on-year decreases of 3.1% and 18% respectively.\nAt the\nEuropean Council in June 2023\n, EU Member States reaffirmed the EU’s multifaceted policy approach towards China, outlined in its\n2019 strategic outlook\n. China is simultaneously a partner, a competitor, and a systemic rival.\nHowever, the balance of challenges and opportunities presented by China has shifted over time. Our economic relationship is critically unbalanced, both in terms of trade flows and of investment, due to a significant asymmetry in our respective market openings. In addition, China’s economic model has brought about systemic distortions with negative spillovers to trading partners. According to the IMF, China’s use of industrial policies, notably its support to priority sectors, has an impact on trading partners.\nFor the EU, ensuring reciprocity, achieving a level-playing field, and addressing asymmetries in the relationship are matters of priority. The EU remains committed to addressing these challenges through dialogue with China and underscores the importance of the WTO as the best avenue to address the root causes of the current imbalance.\nOn 30 December 2020, the EU and China concluded in principle negotiations on the\nComprehensive Agreement on Investment\n(CAI).\nEU-China agreement\nThe EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment in focus.\nBeing adopted or ratified\nTrade picture\nOn\ntrade in goods\n, the EU has long had a trade deficit with China, which reached a record level of €396 billion in 2022.\nIn 2023, the deficit decreased to €292 billion. However, it remains the EU’s second-highest bilateral deficit with China ever. In addition, imports from China have decreased in value, but they are reported to have increased in volume terms.\nIn 2023, the goods that the EU most imported from China were: telecommunications equipment, electrical machinery and apparatus, and automatic data-processing machines.\nThe goods that the EU most exported to China in 2023 were: motor cars and vehicles, medicaments, and other machinery.\nAs regards trade in services, the EU has long had a trade surplus with China. In 2023, the surplus amounted to €14.1 billion. China is the EU’s fourth-biggest services trading partner after the United States, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.\nThe cumulative value of EU foreign direct investment (FDI) stocks in China since 2000 stood at €177 billion in Q1 2024.\nEU FDI flows to China reached €6.4 billion in 2023 – a decrease of 29% compared with 2022. The top three sectors were the automotive sector, basic materials, and machinery.\nThe cumulative value of Chinese FDI stocks in the EU-27 since 2000 stood at €143 billion in Q1 2024.\nChinese FDI flows to the EU amounted to €4.7 billion in 2023, a decrease of 10% compared with 2022. The top three sectors\nwere the automotive sector; health, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; and information and communication technology.\nWhile mergers and acquisitions made up the bulk of China’s investments until 2021, in 2022 and 2023 greenfield investment made up most of China’s FDI in the EU.\nConsult the\nlatest available data\non investment between the EU and China.\nThe EU and China\nThe EU sees China as a partner for cooperation, an economic competitor, and a systemic rival. Recently, EU-China relations have become increasingly complex.\nIn recent years, the EU has conveyed its growing concerns regarding systemic imbalances that characterise the Chinese economy. China’s distortive industrial policies and practices – in particular with regard to widespread support for the manufacturing sector – create overcapacity in China, with negative externalities for a wide range of WTO members.\nAnother area of concern is China’s drive towards import substitution and self-sufficiency. While the EU welcomes efforts by the Chinese authorities to attract foreign direct investment, EU companies continue to face discrimination in the Chinese market, and it remains difficult for European businesses in China to compete due to the lack of a level playing field. Moreover, despite the Chinese government’s stated ambition to pursue a high-level opening of its market and build mutually beneficial trade partnerships, China still remains largely closed in many important sectors.\nMany European companies feel that the business environment in China has become more politicised over the years. Economic challenges have increased, while regulatory obstacles have remained largely unchanged, which has further negatively impacted the business outlook. A complex and non-transparent legal framework on cybersecurity, combined with restrictive rules on cross-border data flows subject to broadly applied security approvals, insufficient enforcement of intellectual property rights and requirements leading to technology transfer, and a broad concept of national security all further affect the business environment.\nThe EU is committed to de-risking, not decoupling from China. This entails reducing critical dependencies and vulnerabilities, including in EU supply chains, and diversifying where necessary.\nAt the same time, recognising the importance of maintaining open communication channels, the EU continues to pursue cooperation with China at both bilateral and multilateral level. The EU and China discuss policies and issues regarding trade and investment in a range of dialogues, of which the most important are:\nThe Annual EU-China Summit: Presidential-level exchange to enhance policy coordination on the most important issues, including trade, and;\nThe EU-China High Level Economic and Trade Dialogue (HLED): a Vice-President of the European Commission and the Chinese Vice Premier meet to discuss issues. They are accompanied, if needed, by EU commissioners and Chinese ministers.\nAt global level, the EU is committed to working to reform the World Trade Organisation to respond to the challenges of the Green and Digital Transitions, while promoting a global level playing field. The EU calls on China to play a part commensurate to its economic weight to help achieve these reform objectives.\nTrading with China\nImporting into the EU\nfrom China\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom China\nExporting from the EU\nto China\nTrade defence measures in force in China\nTrade relations are part of\nthe EU's overall political and economic relations with China\nChina is a\nmember of the World Trade Organization\nEU-China trade issues referred to the\nWTO Dispute Settlement\nBody by the EU against China and by others, including China against the EU\nThe\nEuropean Union Chamber of Commerce in China\n(EUCCC) celebrates European companies’ success in China, but also urges China's leaders\nnot to turn inward\nThe EU supports\nEuropean SMEs\nin exporting to and investing in China, and also offers SMEs\nspecific advice on IPR issues\nLatest news\nNews article\n11 April 2025\nEU takes action against dumped imports of food flavour enhancer\nThe European Commission has extended its anti-dumping measures on imports of monosodium glutamate (MSG) from China, to cover imports from Malaysia.\n1 min read\nNews article\n19 March 2025\nEU imposes duties on dumped glass fibre yarns from China\nThe Commission has imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of glass fibre yarns from China, directly protecting 1,200 EU jobs and further shielding the EU’s glass fibre sector from unfair trading practices.\n1 min read\nNews article\n14 March 2025\nCommission imposes duties on unfairly subsidised imports of aluminium road wheels from Morocco\nThe European Commission has imposed countervailing duties on imports of aluminium road wheels from Morocco, shielding EU producers and defending 16,600 jobs from unfair trading practices.\n1 min read\nAll the latest news on EU trade\nShare this page",

It creates a free-trade area between the EU and Egypt by removing tariffs on industrial products and making agricultural products easier to trade.\nAnother\nagreement on agricultural, processed agricultural and fisheries products\nentered into force on 1 June 2010.\nThe EU and Egypt began talks about a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area in June 2013. Negotiations are currently on hold.\nTrade picture\nEgypt is the EU’s 30\nth\nlargest trading partner, representing 0.6% of the EU’s total trade in goods with the world in 2023.\nThe EU is Egypt's biggest trading partner, covering 25% of Egypt's trade volume in 2023. 23.3% of Egypt’s imports came from the EU in 2023, and 28.1% of Egypt’s exports went to the EU.\nTotal trade in goods between the EU and Egypt amounted to €26.4 billion in 2023.\nEgyptian goods imports into the EU decreased by 29.4% from €16.4 billion to €11.5 billion in 2023 and largely comprise the following three categories: Mineral products, €2.9 billion (25.0%), a 59.1% decrease compared to €7.1 billion in 2022; Chemical products, €2.5 billion (21.5%), a 28.9% decrease compared to €3.5 billion in 2022; Manufactured goods, €2.3 billion (19.5%), an increase of 1.4% compared to €2.2 billion in 2022.\nThe EU's goods exports to Egypt remained relatively stable: €20.9 billion in 2022 compared to €21.2 billion in 2023 (+1.2%). The majority of EU goods exports to Egypt 2023 consists of machinery and transport equipment, which accounted for €7.7 billion (36.3%) in 2023. Compared to 2022, this represents an increase of 20.8%. The biggest export categories in 2023 were: Chemical products, €3.5 billion (16.3%) compared to €3.8 billion in 2022 (-9.6%); Manufactured goods, €2.2 billion (10.5%) compared to €2.5 billion in 2022 (-9.8%).\nBilateral trade in services amounted to €14.3 billion in 2022. EU imports of services from Egypt represented €7.9 billion and exports to Egypt amounted to €6.4 billion. The EU's main service exports to Egypt are transport, telecommunication and other business services, while EU imports from Egypt consist mainly of travel services and transport.\nThe EU and Egypt\nIn June 2013, the EU and Egypt began discussing how to deepen their trade and investment relations through a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA). A future DCFTA would aim to improve market access and the investment climate. It would also support Egyptian economic reforms. It would extend beyond the Association Agreement to include i.a. trade in services, government procurement, competition, intellectual property rights, and investments. The EU commissioned a\nSustainability Impact Assessment\n(SIA) for a possible DCFTA with Egypt in 2014. However, the DCFTA negotiations have not yet started.\nFrom January 2014, due to its Association Agreement with the EU, Egypt stopped benefitting from preferential access to the EU market under the\nGeneralised Scheme of Preferences\n(GSP).\nThe\nPartnership Priorities\nagreed between the EU and Egypt aim to address common challenges facing the EU and Egypt, to promote joint interests and to guarantee long-term stability on both sides of the Mediterranean.\nThe Partnership Priorities are guided by a shared commitment to the universal values of democracy, the rule of law and the respect of human rights. They also aim to reinforce cooperation in support of Egypt's \"Sustainable Development Strategy – Vision-2030”.\nThis partnership includes support to Egypt's sustainable economic and social development, good governance, the rule of law, human rights, migration, security, counter-terrorism, and cooperation in foreign policy through intensified consultations on regional and international issues.\nIn the\nEU Trade Policy Review\nof February 2021, the EU has proposed a new sustainable investment initiative to interested partners in Africa and the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood. Fostering strategic interdependencies and enhancing the EU’s relations and economic integration with its Southern Neighbourhood is a strategic necessity for long-term regional stability.\nIn November 2010, the EU and Egypt signed a protocol creating a dispute settlement mechanism that applies to the trade parts of the Association Agreement. Egypt has not yet ratified the protocol.\nFinancial support\nThe\nEuropean Neighbourhood Policy\nprovides political and financial assistance to Egypt. The EU committed €756 million to bilateral assistance for Egypt for the period 2017-2020, under the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI). The funding supported cooperation priorities agreed with Egypt in three areas, namely: (i) economic modernisation, energy sustainability and environment; (ii) social development and social protection and; (iii) governance, enhancing stability and modern democratic state.\nUnder the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2021-2027, the EU will adopt a broad new financial cooperation instrument: the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI). The NDICI will be the basis of future EU-Egypt cooperation.\nMore information on EU support to Egypt is available from the\nDirectorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations\n.\nEgypt in the Southern Neighbourhood\nEgypt is one of the partners of the EU’s ’Southern Neighbourhood’ (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine*, Syria and Tunisia).\nThe EU established its privileged partnership with the Eastern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean back in 1995 with the launch of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership at the Barcelona Conference, aiming to create an area of peace, stability and economic prosperity that upholds democratic values and human rights.\nThe 25th anniversary of the Barcelona Process in November 2020 was an opportunity to reflect on the strategic partnership with the region in light of the political, socioeconomic, financial and environmental challenges exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and to reassess the EU’s partnership with Egypt and the other Southern Neighbourhood partner countries. Following consultations with partners, this reflection resulted in a Joint Communication by the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on\n‘A renewed partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood – A new Agenda for the Mediterranean\n’ and the annexed\n‘Economic and Investment Plan for the Southern Neighbours’\nin February 2021.\nMore information on the Southern Neighbourhood\nIn 2004, Egypt signed the Agadir Agreement with Jordan, Morocco, and Tunisia. This agreement committed the signatory parties to removing all tariffs on trade between them and to harmonise their legislation with regard to standards and customs procedures. The Agadir Agreement entered into force in July 2006, and an Agadir Technical Unit in Amman ensures its implementation. Lebanon and Palestine joined the Agreement in 2020.\nThe impact of trade component of the EU’s Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Egypt was assessed in\nthe Ex-Post Evaluation of Trade Chapters of the Six Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements\nwith the EU’s Southern Neighbours (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia), which was published by the European Commission in 2021.\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation and the PEM Convention on rules of origin\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation system of origin was created in 2005. It brings together the EU, Egypt, and other partners in Europe and the Mediterranean to support regional integration by creating a common system of rules of origin. Rules of origin are technical criteria which determine whether a specific product qualifies for duty-free or other preferential access under a given trade agreement.\nCumulation of origin means a product coming from one partner country can be processed or added to a product of a second partner country and still be considered an ‘originating product’ of that second partner country for the purposes of a particular trade agreement.\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean system allows for diagonal cumulation (i.e. cumulation between two or more countries) between the EU, EFTA countries, Turkey, the Western Balkans, the Faroe Islands, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and any country that signed the Barcelona Declaration of 1995. The system was originally based on a network of Free Trade Agreements with identical origin protocols. These individual origin protocols are being progressively replaced by a reference to the\nregional convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin\n(PEM Convention), which was established in 2011 to provide a more unified framework for origin protocols. Egypt joined the regional convention in October 2013.\nMore information on Mediterranean preferential Rules of Origin\nCommittees and Dialogues\nThe EU and Egypt meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the Agreement.\nTechnical committee meetings - agendas and reports\nTrading with Egypt\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Egypt\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Egypt\nExporting from the EU\nto Egypt\nTrade defence measures in force in Egypt\nTrade relations are part of\nthe EU's overall political and economic relations with Egypt\nEgypt is a\nmember of the World Trade Organization\nMap of Egypt: The designations employed and the presentation of material on this map do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the European Union concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.\n* Palestine: This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue\nLatest news\nNews article\n10 January 2025\nCommission counters dumped polyvinyl chloride from USA and Egypt\nToday, the European Commission imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) from Egypt and the USA.\n1 min read\nPress release\n26 January 2022\nEU challenges Egyptian import restrictions at the WTO\nThe EU has requested dispute settlement consultations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) with Egypt on its compulsory import registration requirements.\n1 min read\nNews article\n17 December 2021\nCommission initiates two anti-circumvention investigations on imports of glass fibre fabrics\nThe Commission initiated on 16 December 2021 two anti-circumvention investigations regarding possible circumvention via Turkey of the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures imposed in 2020 against imports of glass fibre fabrics from China and Egypt.\n1 min read\nAll the latest news on EU trade\nShare this page",

The EU’s exports totalled €1.031 million, led by manufactured products (€577 million, 56%).\nThe EU and the Faroe Islands\nThe Faroe Islands have a unique relationship with the EU given that it is neither part of the EU, nor a member of the EEA unlike Norway and Iceland, nor an Overseas Country and Territory, like Greenland. With extensive autonomy under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark, the Faroe Islands decided not to become a part of the European Communities when Denmark joined in 1973. As such, the Treaties do not apply to the Faroe Islands (TFEU Article 355, 5 (a)). Formal relations between the EU and the Faroe Islands are currently based on three separate bilateral agreements dealing with\nfisheries\n, trade in goods and\nscientific and technological cooperation\n.\nIn March 2024, the EU and the Faroe Islands signed a\nMemorandum of Understanding\n(MoU) on enhanced cooperation. The MoU recognises shared values, principles and commitments to democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights, peace and stability, international law, and sustainable development.\nThe Free Trade Agreement between the EU and the Faroe Islands, which covers trade in goods, came into effect in 1997.

It is based on the principles of the World Trade Organisation.  It removes all import duties on goods and provides for broad mutual access to trade in services. It allows EU and Georgian companies to set up a subsidiary or a branch office on a non-discriminatory basis. This allows the foreign company to benefit from the same treatment as domestic companies in the partner’s market.\nThe DCFTA is a vehicle to allow to bring Georgian trade-related legislation closer to selected pieces of the EU legal framework.

The aim is to contribute to unlocking the untapped potential of two-way trade and investment between the EU and India.\nCurrently, India’s trade regime and regulatory environment remains relatively restrictive. Technical barriers to trade (TBT), sanitary and phyto-sanitary (SPS) measures, deviation from internationally-agreed standards, as well as discrimination based on legislative or administrative measures by India, affect a wide range of sectors, including goods, services, public procurement and investment.\nThe EU uses all available channels and fora to work with India to ensure fair market access and predictable investment conditions, as well as to promote the full respect by both sides of their multilateral obligations under the World Trade Organization (WTO). Key instruments in this respect are the EU-India High-Level Dialogue on Trade and Investment established in 2021 by a decision of the July 2020 EU-India Summit, as well as the EU-India Trade Sub-Commission established under the 1994 Cooperation and Partnership Agreement between the EU and India, and its specialised working groups and dialogues.\nFor more information\nMore information on the EU-India strategic partnership, including in the area of trade and investment, can be found on the\nnew EU Strategy for India adopted on 20 November 2018\nand the\nrelated Council conclusions\n.\nAlso relevant are the joint statements adopted on the occasion of the\nEU-India Summit\nheld on 15 July 2020 and the\nEU-India Leaders’ Meeting\nheld on 8 May 2021.\nEU-India trade negotiations\nOn 8 May 2021, the EU and Indian leaders’ agreed to resume negotiations for a\n“balanced, ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial”\ntrade agreement, and to launch separate negotiations on an investment protection agreement and an agreement on geographical indications (GIs).

It provides preferential elements and substantial market access to EU companies, namely in public procurement (the same treatment that national companies get), services and establishment and investment in Iraq.\nThe last meeting of the EU-Iraq Sub-committee on trade and related policies took place on 15 December 2020.\nIraq is not a member of the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO)\n.

The agreement aims to provide an appropriate legal and institutional framework for political dialogue and economic cooperation between the EU and Israel.\nTrade picture\nIsrael is the EU’s 25\nth\nbiggest trade partner, representing 0.8% of the EU’s total trade in goods in 2022. It is also among the EU’s main trading partners in the Mediterranean area.\nThe EU is Israel’s biggest trade partner, accounting for 28.8% of its trade in goods in 2022. 31.9% of Israel’s imports came from the EU, and 25.6% of the country’s exports went to the EU.\nTotal trade in goods between the EU and Israel in 2022 amounted to €46.8 billion. The EU’s imports from Israel were worth €17.5 billion and were led by machinery and transport equipment (€7.6 billion, 43.5%), chemicals (€3.5 billion, 20.1%), and other manufactured goods (€1.9 billion, 11.1%). The EU’s exports to Israel amounted to €12.2 billion and were dominated by machinery and transport equipment (€12.3 billion, 41.9%), chemicals (€5.1 billion, 17.6%), and other manufactured goods (€3.5 billion, 12.1%).\nTwo-way trade in services between the EU and Israel amounted to €16.7 billion in 2021. EU imports of services represented €6.9 billion, while exports accounted for €9.8 billion.\nThe EU and Israel\nTrade relations between the EU and Israel are governed by a Free Trade Area that is part of 2000's EU-Israel Association Agreement.\nNegotiations to open up additional agricultural trade between the EU and Israel were concluded in 2008. That\nagreement\nhas been in force since January 2010.\nIn 2012, the EU and Israel concluded an\nAgreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA)\nin pharmaceuticals. It facilitates bilateral trade, removes trade barriers and provides mutual recognition of pharmaceutical certification.\nTrade and economic relations between the EU and Israel are further enhanced by the\nEuro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement\n(the so-called ‘Open Skies’ aviation agreement), which fully entered into force in 2018 and further opened EU-Israel air travel.\nFebruary 2021’s\nEU Trade Policy Review\nstated that the EU will propose a new sustainable investment initiative to interested partners in Africa and the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood. Fostering strategic interdependencies and enhancing the EU’s relations and economic integration with its Southern Neighbourhood is a strategic necessity for long-term regional stability.\nGoods originating from Israeli settlements in territories that have been under Israeli administration since June 1967 are not entitled to benefit from any preferential tariff treatment (neither under the EU-Israel Association Agreement, nor under the Interim Association Agreement on Trade and Cooperation signed with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on behalf of the Palestinian Authority).\nThis differentiation between products originating in Israel and the settlements is ensured via a 'Technical Arrangement' between the EU and Israel customs authorities, which has been in force since 2004.  The Arrangement requires proofs of origin issued in Israel to identify the place where the production process relevant for rules of origin purposes occurred. A list is published by the Commission identifying (by name and postal code), the areas occupied by Israel since 1967. That list is updated regularly (most recently in June 2023). Importers cannot request preferential treatment for goods originating in such areas.\nIn practical terms, this means that Israeli certificates of origin indicate the postal codes of the place of manufacture that enable EU Member States’ customs to identify the real origin of products. Only products originating in Israel proper are granted trade preferences under the EU-Israel Association Agreement. In case they come from an Israeli settlement they are denied preferential treatment when imported into the EU.\nMonitoring of the correct origin indication by importers is the task of Member States’ customs authorities.\nMoreover, to further ensure the correct implementation of the Technical Arrangement with Israel (with the ultimate objective that Israeli exports from the settlements should not benefit from any trade preferences),\nDG TAXUD on 16 May 2023 introduced a new customs code\n. It does not imply any modification to the Technical Arrangement, but it is just related to its implementation.\nFinancial support\nThe\nEuropean Neighbourhood Policy\nprovides political and financial assistance to Israel. Due to Israel’s advanced level of economic development, EU funds under the European Neighborhood Instrument (ENI) are mostly used for twinning and public administration (TAIEX) projects in the areas of education, telecommunication and water management. On average, this amounts to €1.8 million per year.\nUnder the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2021-2027, the EU will adopt a broad new financial cooperation instrument: the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI). The NDICI will replace ENI and contribute to future EU-Israel cooperation.\nMore information on EU support is available from the\nDirectorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations\n.\nIsrael in the Southern Neighbourhood\nIsrael is one of the partners of the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine*, Syria and Tunisia). The EU established its privileged partnership with the countries of the Eastern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean back in 1995 with the launch of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership at the Barcelona Conference, aiming to establish an area of peace, stability and economic prosperity that upholds democratic values and human rights.\nThe 25\nth\nanniversary of the Barcelona Process in November 2020 was an opportunity to reflect on the strategic partnership with the region in light of the political, socioeconomic, financial and environmental challenges exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and to reassess the EU’s partnership with Israel and other Southern Neighbourhood partner countries. Following consultations with partners, this reflection resulted in the Joint Communication by the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on ‘\nA renewed partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood - A new Agenda for the Mediterranean\n‘ and the annexed ’\nEconomic and Investment Plan for the Southern Neighbours\n‘ in February 2021.\nMore information on the Southern Neighbourhood\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation and the PEM Convention on rules of origin\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation system of origin was created in 2005. It brings together the EU, Israel, and other partners in Europe and the Mediterranean to support regional integration by creating a common system of rules of origin. Rules of origin are technical criteria which determine whether a specific product qualifies for duty-free or other preferential access under a given trade agreement.\nCumulation of origin means a product coming from one partner country can be processed or added to a product of a second partner country and still be considered an ‘originating product’ of that second partner country for the purposes of a particular trade agreement.\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean system allows for diagonal cumulation (i.e. cumulation between two or more countries) between the EU, EFTA countries, Turkey, the Western Balkans, the Faroe Islands, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, and any country that signed the Barcelona Declaration of 1995. The system was originally based on a network of Free Trade Agreements with identical origin protocols.\nThese individual origin protocols are being progressively replaced by a reference to the\nRegional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin\n(PEM Convention), which was established in 2011 to provide a more unified framework for origin protocols. Israel signed the Regional Convention on 10 October 2013, and it has also ratified it.\nMore information on Mediterranean preferential Rules of Origin\nTrading with Israel\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Israel\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Israel\nExporting from the EU\nto Israel\nTrade defence measures in force in Israel\nTrade relations are part of\nthe EU's overall political and economic relations with Israel\nIsrael is a\nmember of the World Trade Organization\n*\nThis designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue\n.\nShare this page",

Trade in services amounted to €54.2 billion in 2023 (compared to €47 billion in 2019), representing an increase of 14.3%, with the EU enjoying an €18 billion surplus.\nJapanese investment stock in the EU is very significant (€236 billion), mainly in the Netherlands and Germany, while EU investment in Japan amounts to €92 billion (2022 figures).\nThe EU and Japan\nThe EPA has achieved a high degree of trade liberalisation (at full implementation, it liberalises 99% of tariff lines for the EU and 97% of tariff lines for Japan, with partial liberalisation of the remaining lines).\nThe slightly lower degree of liberalisation for Japan can be explained by the sensitivity of the agricultural sector. However, with respect to the 3% of tariff lines that are not fully liberalised, Japan has given significant concessions in terms of tariff rate quotas and/or tariff reductions. Furthermore, the lower figure is also largely compensated by the significant effort made by Japan in addressing a large number of non-tariff measures.\nIndustrial tariffs are to be fully eliminated on both sides at the end of the transitional periods established by the EPA. The agreement has ensured a significant opening of the Japanese agricultural market to EU exporters. Preferential access for the EU to the Japanese market takes the form of tariff-rate quotas for 25 agricultural product categories (in particular, for some key exports, such as cheeses, starches and several food preparation items), as well as of total or partial tariff liberalisation at entry into force or at the end of a transitional period (for instance, for meat exports).\nIn the sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) area, the implementation of the EPA has led to improved market access for European beef producers, following Japan’s approval of certain Member States' beef applications, as committed at the EU-Japan Summit in July 2023. The EU and Japan continue to work on improving market access for poultry and pork (with mutual recognition projects on regionalisation for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) and African Swine Fever (ASF)), as well as for fruits. In addition, the EU and Japan are working to simplify market access approval procedures for plant products.\nSince the EPA's entry into force, the list of geographical indications that it protects has been extended three times, for a total number of 423 GIs (291 for the EU, 132 for Japan).\nOn 1 July 2024,\nnew provisions on cross-border data flows were added to the EPA\n, facilitating business on both sides and sending a strong signal against digital protectionism.\nMoreover, through the update of the EPA's ‘Car Annex’ in 2021, and by incorporating additional UN regulations, the EU and Japan are striving to further align their regulatory frameworks in the automotive sector with the internationally harmonised rules of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).\nBeyond the institutional structure set up by the EPA, the trade and investment relationship between the EU and Japan is supported by a number of bilateral dialogues and other specific initiatives:\nThe High-Level Economic Dialogue (HLED), which meets at ministerial level, and focuses on economic issues beyond the EPA. Recent dialogues have been devoted to strengthening cooperation on economic security (see '\nJoint Press Statement on the 5th EU-Japan High Level Economic Dialogue\n').\nThe EU-Japan Business Round Table\nallows for a dialogue and an exchange of views between government authorities and businesses from both sides.\nEU companies exports and investment into Japan are supported by the Executive Training Programme and the\nEU Gateway Programme\n, which provide European enterprises with logistical and legal assistance and with business match-making events.\nThe EU-Japan Centre for Industrial Cooperation\npromotes all forms of industrial, trade and investment cooperation between the EU and Japan by helping EU and Japanese businesses to exchange experience and know-how, with a particular emphasis on SMEs.\nCommittees and Dialogues\nThe EU and Japan meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the agreement.\nThe European Commission publishes the agendas (when available) of the committees set up by the EU-Japan EPA, as well as reports and other documents, to provide information about the different steps of the EPA implementation process.

        "description": "Country or region\nJordan\nTrade topics\nNegotiations and agreements\nTrade policy\nThe EU and Jordan have a strong partnership across many sectors and have been linked by an\nAssociation Agreement\nsince 2002. The last EU-Jordan economic stability, sustainable and knowledge-based growth, quality education and job creation cluster (which includes a sub-committee on industry, trade and services) took place on 6 June 2023 via video conference.\nTrade picture\nJordan is the EU’s 63\nth\nbiggest trade partner, representing 0.1% of the EU’s total trade in goods with the world in 2022.\nThe EU is Jordan’s biggest trade partner, accounting for 12% of its trade in 2021. 15.3% of Jordan’s imports came from the EU, but only 4.4% of Jordan’s exports went to the EU.\nTotal trade in goods between the EU and Jordan amounted to €4.9 billion in 2022. The EU’s imports from Jordan amounted to €0.7 billion and were dominated by chemicals (€0.34 billion, 46%). The EU’s exports from Jordan accounted for €4.2 billion and were led by chemicals (€0.67 billion, 16%), machinery and appliances (€0.64 billion, 15%) and vegetables (€0.61 billion, 15%).\nTwo-way trade in services amounted to €1.36 billion euros in 2021. EU imports of services represented €0.46 billion and exports amounted to €0.9 billion.\nThe EU and Jordan\nThe EU and Jordan established a Free Trade Area as part of the EU-Jordan Association Agreement, signed in 1997, which entered into force in May 2002. The EU and Jordan also signed an agreement in the form of an\nExchange of Letters providing for greater liberalisation of their trade in agricultural and processed agricultural products\n, which entered into force in 2006. Trade in industrial products is entirely liberalised, while market opening for agricultural products is substantial. The EU and Jordan also agreed upon a protocol establishing a bilateral\nDispute Settlement Mechanism\n, which entered into force in 2011.\nThe Council of the European Union adopted negotiating directives for a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) with Jordan in 2011. As part of the preparatory process for a DCFTA, an independent contractor carried out a\nSustainability Impact Assessment\n(SIA) in 2014. However, the DCFTA negotiations have not yet started.\nIn July 2016, the EU and Jordan agreed to\nsimplify the rules of origin\nthat Jordanian exporters use in their trade with the EU. This measure allows producers in Jordan to use an alternative set of rules of origin for exports to the EU, provided that a number of conditions are met. It seeks to increase legal employment of Syrian refugees. The initiative was amended in December 2018 to accelerate its uptake and extend its duration. The simplification allows producers in Jordan to use a very advantageous set of rules of origin (equivalent to the ones granted to least-developed countries under the EU’s Everything But Arms initiative), on the condition that their workforces include a set proportion of Syrian refugees. The scheme applies to 52 different product categories including textiles and garments, engineering and electrical products, chemical products, plastic products, and furniture and wood products. This initiative is valid until 31 December 2030; it has already opened up new opportunities for trade with the EU, and its use by Jordanian exporters has increased year-on-year.\nIn 2021, under the new\nEU Trade Policy Review\n, the EU has announced a new sustainable investment initiative to interested partners in the Southern Neighbourhood and Africa.\nThe EU is already a major trade and investment partner for Jordan, and enhancing private investment can be mutually beneficial as it can contribute to the creation of jobs and growth for Jordan and open further investment opportunities for the EU.\nMore on the EU investment mapping in Jordan\nRead the study\nJordan in the Southern Neighbourhood\nJordan is one of the partners of the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine*, Syria and Tunisia).\nThe EU established its privileged partnership with the Eastern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean back in 1995 with the launch of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership at the Barcelona Conference, aiming to establish an area of peace, stability and economic prosperity that upholds democratic values and human rights.\nThe 25\nth\nanniversary of the Barcelona Process in November 2020 was an opportunity to reflect on the strategic partnership with the region in light of the political, socio-economic, financial and environmental challenges exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and to reassess the EU’s partnership with Jordan and the other Southern Neighbourhood partner countries. Following consultations with partners, this reflection resulted in a Joint Communication by the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on\n‘A renewed partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood – A new Agenda for the Mediterranean\n’ and the annexed\n‘Economic and Investment Plan for the Southern Neighbours’\nin February 2021.\nMore information on the Southern Neighbourhood\nIn 2004, Jordan signed the Agadir Agreement with Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia. The agreement committed signatory parties to removing all tariffs on trade between them and to harmonise their legislation on standards and customs procedures. The Agadir Agreement entered into force in July 2006, and an Agadir Technical Unit in Amman ensures its implementation. Lebanon and Palestine joined the Agreement in 2020.\nThe impact of trade component of the EU’s Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Jordan was assessed in the\nEx-Post Evaluation\nof Trade Chapters of the Six Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements with the EU’s Southern Neighbours (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia), which was published by the European Commission in 2021.\nFinancial support\nThe\nEuropean Neighbourhood Policy\nprovides political and financial assistance to Jordan. The EU committed €765 million in bilateral assistance to Jordan for the period 2014-2020, under the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI). The funding supported cooperation priorities agreed with Jordan, namely: (i) enhancing social and economic development; (ii) strengthening the rule of law and; (iii) upgrading border management and preventing violent extremism.\nUnder the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2021-2027, the EU will adopt a broad new financial cooperation instrument: the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI). The NDICI will be the basis of future EU-Jordan cooperation.\nMore information on EU support is available from the\nDirectorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations\n.\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation and the PEM Convention on rules of origin\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation system of origin was created in 2005. It brings together the EU, Jordan, and other partners in Europe and the Mediterranean to support regional integration by creating a common system of rules of origin. Rules of origin are technical criteria which determine whether a specific product qualifies for duty-free or other preferential access under a given trade agreement.\nCumulation of origin means a product coming from one partner country can be processed or added to a product of a second partner country and still be considered an ‘originating product’ of that second partner country for the purposes of a particular trade agreement.\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean system allows for diagonal cumulation (i.e. cumulation between two or more countries) between the EU, EFTA countries, Turkey, the Western Balkans, the Faroe Islands, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and any country that signed the Barcelona Declaration of 1995. The system was originally based on a network of Free Trade Agreements with identical origin protocols.\nThese individual origin protocols are being progressively replaced by a reference to the\nRegional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin\n(PEM Convention), which was established in 2011 to provide a more unified framework for origin protocols. Jordan signed the Regional Convention in 2013 and the internal ratification process was completed on 16 August 2013.\nMore information on Mediterranean preferential Rules of Origin\nCommittees and Dialogues\nThe EU and Jordan meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the Agreement.\nTechnical committee meetings - agendas and reports\nTrading with Jordan\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Jordan\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Jordan\nExporting from the EU\nto Jordan\nTrade defence measures in force in Jordan\nTrade relations are part of\nthe EU's overall political and economic relations with Jordan\nJordan has been a\nmember of the World Trade Organization\nsince 11 April 2000\n* This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue.\nAustria - EU trade deals bring in dough for Austrian bakery\nBackaldrin is a family-owned baking ingredients manufacturer headquartered in Asten, Upper Austria.

        "description": "Country or region\nKazakhstan\nTrade topics\nNegotiations and agreements\nTrade policy\nThe\nEnhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement\n(EPCA), which entered into force on 1 March 2020, governs trade and economic relations between the European Union and Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan is the first Central Asian partner to have concluded an EPCA with the EU.\nThe EU is Kazakhstan’s biggest overall trading partner, as the destination for 37% of total Kazakh exports and representing 27.9% of its total trade in 2023. The EU is also the biggest foreign investor in Kazakhstan, providing €54.8 billion of total foreign direct investment (FDI) stock in 2022: a 5.5% increase compared to 2021.\nTrade picture\nIn 2023, the EU's trade in goods with Kazakhstan totalled €42.4 billion, a 5.6% increase on 2022. EU exports were worth €12.1 billion, a 17.2% increase on 2022, and imports from Kazakhstan reached €30.3 billion (up 1.6% vs. 2022). The trade balance in 2023 was €18.2 billion in favour of Kazakhstan, compared to €19.5 billion in favour of Kazakhstan in 2022.\nThe EU's substantial trade deficit with Kazakhstan mainly results from Kazakhstan's oil and gas exports. Exports from Kazakhstan to the EU are dominated by mineral products (representing 91.5% of total Kazakh exports to the EU in 2023 – €27.7 billion). EU exports to Kazakhstan are more diverse: for example, machinery and transport equipment (52.9% of total EU exports in 2023), chemical products (16.1%), optical products (5.1%), metals (4%), plastics (3.9%), and textiles (3.2%).\nEU services exports to Kazakhstan stood at €2.1 billion in 2022, compared to €1.5 billion in 2021. Imports of services from Kazakhstan stood at €0.99 billion in 2021, vs. €0.7 billion in 2022.\nThe EU and Kazakhstan\nThe EPCA was signed in 2015 and began to be provisionally applied on 1 May 2016. After its ratification by all EU Member States, the agreement entered into force on 1 March 2020, replacing the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of 1999.\nThe EPCA creates a better regulatory environment for businesses in areas such as:\ntrade in services;\nestablishment and operation of companies;\ncapital movements;\nraw materials and energy;\ngovernment procurement, and;\nintellectual property rights.\nThe full implementation of the trade part of the EPCA is an important issue, which will facilitate foreign investment and diversification. There is room for improvement in trade flows in both directions: as regards Kazakhstan's exports to the EU, mineral products (oil, gas and uranium) are over-represented and represent roughly 90% of total exports.\nThis lack of diversification makes Kazakh exports very volatile and exposed to the risk of sudden shocks.\nAs the EU and the world aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades, Kazakhstan needs to make the best possible use of the available time to reduce its dependence on fossil fuel exports. The EU is committed to cooperating with Kazakhstan in making this transition a success.\nIn May 2023, the Commission received a mandate from the Council to negotiate a Protocol to the EPCA with Kazakhstan as regards the protection of Geographical Indications (GIs) for agricultural products and foodstuffs, wines and spirits.\nOn raw materials, on 7 November 2022, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Alikhan Smailov, prime minister of Kazakhstan, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Strategic Partnerships on Sustainable Raw Materials, Batteries, and Renewable Hydrogen Value Chains. The strategic partnership with Kazakhstan on raw materials is part of the EU's policy to ensure access to a secure, diversified, affordable and sustainable supply of critical raw materials.\nThe MoU provides a political framework for enhanced cooperation in the current geopolitical context, while aiming to ensure the development of a secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials and refined materials vital for the green and digital transitions and for the decarbonisation of energy production. By aiming to develop renewable hydrogen and battery value chains, it will boost the green and digital transformation of both sides’ economies. A 2023-2024 roadmap setting out concrete action to achieve the MoU's goals has been agreed with Kazakhstan.\nOn 17 June 2019, the Council adopted Conclusions on a new\nEU Strategy on Central Asia\n, which provides a framework for strengthening regional cooperation, and for addressing new opportunities and challenges in the region.\nThe Strategy on Central Asia offers a broad basis for cooperation and has since been complemented by the Global Gateway Strategy and the European Green Deal, which are also relevant for the EU’s relations with the region. Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine and the ensuing challenge of preventing the circumvention of EU sanctions against Russia, while seeking even deeper and closer trade relations between the EU and Central Asian countries, will have to be handled in parallel.\nKazakhstan and the WTO\nKazakhstan became the 162\nnd\nmember of the WTO in 2015. The EU had consistently supported Kazakhstan’s accession.\nCooperation Council\nHigh-level discussions on progress made in implementing the EPCA take place annually in the framework of the EU-Kazakhstan Cooperation Council. Its 20th meeting was held on 23 May 2023 in Astana.\nTechnical dialogue on trade, investment and customs takes place regularly in the Cooperation Committee in Trade Configuration and in the Customs Sub-Committee.\nIn addition, in summer 2019, a high-level EU-Kazakhstan Business Platform was launched in order to make possible direct dialogue between Kazakh authorities, business representatives and EU Heads of Mission.\nIt brings to the attention of the Kazakh leadership concrete business climate difficulties, as well as opportunities (it helps to solve concrete cases, based on close cooperation with EU Member States and companies, in particular for addressing concerns shared by EU investors with regard to some taxation issues).\nCommittees and Dialogues\nThe EU and Kazakhstan meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the Agreement.\nTechnical committee meetings - agendas and reports\nTrading with Kazakhstan\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Kazakhstan\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Kazakhstan\nExporting from the EU\nto Kazakhstan\nTrade defence measures in force in Kazakhstan\nTrade relations are part of\nthe EU's overall political and economic relations with Kazakhstan\nKazakhstan is a\nmember of the World Trade Organization\nLatest news\nNews article\n14 May 2024\nEU tackles circumvention of anti-dumping tariffs on birch plywood imports\nToday, the European Commission has extended anti-dumping measures on imports of birch plywood from Russia to imports from Kazakhstan and Türkiye.\n1 min read\nAll the latest news on EU trade\nShare this page",

The EU was Laos's 111\nth\nlargest trade partner in 2023.\nIn 2023, the EU imported goods worth €403 million from Laos. Textiles, footwear and agricultural products dominate EU imports from Laos.\nIn 2023, the EU exported goods worth €147 million to Laos, which mainly consisted of machinery and appliances.\nThe EU and Laos\nAs a Least Developed Country (LDC), Laos benefits from the most favourable regime available under the EU's\nGeneralised Scheme of Preferences (GSP)\n, namely the Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme.\nThe EU’s GSP regulation allows vulnerable developing countries to pay fewer or no duties on exports to the EU, giving them vital access to the EU market and contributing to their growth. The EBA scheme is one arm of the GSP, which grants duty-free and quota-free access to the EU for all products (except arms and ammunition) for the world's Least Developed Countries, as defined by the United Nations.\nThe GSP Regulation provides that trade preferences may be suspended in case of \"serious and systematic violation of principles\" laid down in the human rights and labour rights Conventions listed in Annex VIII of the Regulation.\nLaos and ASEAN\nLaos is one of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

Laos is one of the three Least Developed Countries in ASEAN.\nThe EU co-operates with ASEAN as a whole. Cooperation is maintained through the EU-ASEAN Dialogue, which includes discussions on trade and investment issues at ministerial and senior economic official level.\nEnsuring better access for EU exporters to the dynamic ASEAN market is a priority for the EU. Negotiations for a region-to-region trade and investment agreement between the EU and ASEAN were launched in 2007 and paused by mutual agreement in 2009 to give way to a bilateral format of negotiations.\nThese bilateral trade and investment agreements were conceived as building blocks towards a future region-to-region agreement.\nMore information on ASEAN\nTrading with Laos\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Laos\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Laos\nExporting from the EU\nto Laos\nTrade defence measures in force in Laos\nTrade relations are part of\nthe EU's overall political and economic relations with Laos\nLaos is a\nmember of the World Trade Organization\nShare this page",

        "description": "Country or region\nLebanon\nTrade topics\nNegotiations and agreements\nTrade policy\nLebanon signed an\nAssociation Agreement\nwith the EU in June 2002, which entered into force in April 2006. As a result, Lebanese industrial as well as most agricultural products benefit from free access to the EU market.\nTrade picture\nLebanon is the EU’s 61\nst\nbiggest trade partner (2022).\nThe EU is Lebanon’s biggest trade partner, accounting for 28.4% of its total trade in goods in 2022: 32% of Lebanon’s imports came from the EU and 12.4% of Lebanon’s exports went to the EU.\nTotal trade in goods between the EU and Lebanon in 2022 amounted to €6.26 billion. The EU’s imports from Lebanon amounted to €0.6 billion and consisted mainly of crude materials (€0.2 billion, 33.8%), manufactured goods (€0.12 billion, 19.8%), and machinery and transport equipment (€0.12 billion, 12.2%). The EU’s exports to Lebanon were worth €5.66 billion and were dominated by fuel and mineral fuels (€2.82 billion, 50%), machinery and transport equipment (€0.61 billion, 10.9%), food and live animals (€0.58 billion, 10.2%) and chemicals (€0.56 billion, 9.9%).\nThe Lebanese economy is based primarily on the service sector, which accounted for 76% of the country’s GDP in 2019, according to World Bank data. Two-way trade in services totalled €1.6 billion in 2021, with EU imports of services representing €0.6 billion and exports €1 billion. Construction, tourism, and financial services are the most prominent sectors among Lebanon's exports and imports of commercial services.\nThe EU and Lebanon\nThe EU-Lebanon Association Agreement progressively liberalised trade in goods between the EU and Lebanon. It was implemented gradually between 2008 and 2014. Lebanese industrial and most agricultural products benefit from free access to the EU market, with a view to creating a bilateral Free Trade Area.\nIn November 2010, the EU and Lebanon signed\na protocol establishing a dispute settlement mechanism\napplicable to disputes under the trade provisions of the Association Agreement.\nThe Free Trade Area (FTA) of the EU-Lebanon Association Agreement grants preferential treatment for Lebanese exports to the EU. In January 2014, the EU implemented changes to its\nGeneralised Scheme of Preferences (GSP)\n, which removes import duties from products coming into the EU from vulnerable developing countries. As a result, countries that already had preferential market access to the EU, like Lebanon due to its FTA, stopped benefiting from the GSP treatment in 2014.\nIn 2021, under the new\nEU Trade Policy Review\n, the EU will propose a new sustainable investment initiative to partners in the Southern Neighbourhood and Africa interested in doing so. Fostering strategic interdependencies and enhancing EU’s relations and economic integration with the Southern Neighbourhood is a strategic necessity for long-term stability.\nLebanon started to negotiate its accession to the\nWTO\nwhen the Working Party was established on 14 April 1999. The EU continues to support Lebanon’s efforts, as the negotiations are still ongoing.\nLebanon's economy is characterised by a high level of imports and by substantial trade deficits. The deficits are largely offset by foreign income earnings, including capital inflows and remittances from the Lebanese diaspora, as well as the tourism, banking and insurance sectors.\nFinancial support\nThe European Neighbourhood Policy\nprovides political and financial assistance to Lebanon. The EU committed €402.3 million to bilateral assistance for Lebanon for the period 2014-2020, under the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI). The funding supported cooperation priorities agreed with Lebanon, namely: (i) promoting growth and job creation; (ii) fostering local governance and socio-economic development, and; (iii) promoting the rule of law and enhancing security.\nUnder the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2021-2027, the EU will adopt a broad new financial cooperation instrument: the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI). The NDICI will be the basis of future EU-Lebanon cooperation.\nMore information on EU support is available from\nthe Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations\n.\nLebanon in the Southern Neighbourhood\nLebanon is one of the partners of the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine*, Syria and Tunisia). The EU established its privileged partnership with the Eastern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean back in 1995 with the launch of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership at the Barcelona Conference, aiming to establish an area of peace, stability and economic prosperity that upholds democratic values and human rights.\nThe 25th anniversary of the Barcelona Process in November 2020 was an opportunity to reflect on the strategic partnership with the region in light of the political, socioeconomic, financial and environmental challenges exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and to reassess the EU’s partnership with Lebanon and the other Southern Neighbourhood partner countries.

The agreement committed all parties to removing all tariffs on trade between one another and to harmonising their legislation on standards and customs procedures. An Agadir Technical Unit in Amman ensures the implementation of the Agadir Agreement.\nMore information on the Agadir Agreement\nThe impact of trade component of the EU’s Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Lebanon was assessed in the\nEx-Post Evaluation\nof Trade Chapters of the Six Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement\ns\nwith the EU’s Southern Neighbours (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia), which was published by the European Commission in 2021.\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation and the PEM Convention on rules of origin\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation system of origin was created in 2005. It brings together the EU, Lebanon, and other partners in Europe and the Mediterranean to support regional integration by creating a common system of rules of origin. Rules of origin are  technical criteria which determine whether a specific product qualifies for duty-free or other preferential access under a given trade agreement.\nCumulation of origin means that a product coming from one partner country can be processed or added to a product of a second partner country and still be considered as an ‘originating product’ of that second partner country for the purposes of a particular trade agreement.\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean system allows for diagonal cumulation (i.e. cumulation between two or more countries) between the EU, EFTA countries, Turkey, the Western Balkans, the Faroe Islands, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and any country that signed the Barcelona Declaration of 1995. The system was originally based on a network of Free Trade Agreements with identical origin protocols.\nThese individual origin protocols are being progressively replaced by a reference to the\nRegional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin\n(PEM Convention), which was\nestablished in 2011\nto provide a more unified framework for origin protocols. Lebanon signed the Regional Convention on 22 October 2014.

        "description": "Country or region\nLibya\nTrade topics\nNegotiations and agreements\nTrade policy\nTrade relations between the European Union and Libya have been marked by the country’s long-lasting crisis, instability and lack of political settlement. Alongside Syria, Libya is the only partner among the Southern Neighbourhood (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine*, Syria and Tunisia) not to have an Association Agreement with the EU.\nTrade picture\nLibya was the EU’s 32nd biggest trade partner in 2023.\nThe EU is Libya’s biggest trade partner, representing 56.4% of the country’s global trade in goods in 2023.\nTotal trade in goods between the EU and Libya in 2023 amounted to €29.8 billion. The EU’s imports from Libya amounted to €22.9 billion and were dominated by fuel and mining products (€22.9 billion, 98.9%), in particular petroleum and petroleum products (€21.5 billion, 93.7%). The EU’s exports to Libya were worth €6.8 billion and were dominated by fuel and mining products (€3.6 billion, 53.3%), agricultural and raw materials (€1.1 billion, 16.3%) and machinery and transport equipment (€0.9 billion, 14.6%).\nTwo-way trade in services totalled €1.0 billion in 2022, with EU imports of services representing €0.52 billion and exports €0.48 billion.\nThe EU and Libya\nThe EU has no trade arrangements with Libya. In 2008, the EU and Libya started negotiations for a Framework Agreement on trade. However, these negotiations were suspended in February 2011 due to the ongoing political crisis. Even though the EU assists Libya with its political transition to a stable and prosperous country, with the resumption of bilateral trade negotiations remaining an option in the future, the current lack of a political settlement prevents any trade discussions from taking place at the moment.\nLibya is not a\nWTO\nmember. Libya’s accession negotiations to the organisation started in July 2004 with the establishment of a Working Party. However, the negotiation process remains stalled.\nFinancial support\nThe European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) was the key EU financing instrument for bilateral cooperation in Libya for the period 2014-2020. During this period, the EU’s financial assistance to Libya was worth €98 million and focused on the following priority sectors: governance, economic development, health, and support for civil society and young people.\nUnder the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2021-2027, the EU will adopt a broad new financial cooperation instrument: the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), which will replace the ENI. Due to the unstable political situation in Libya, since 2017 the EU has planned its financial assistance through yearly ‘Special Measures’, rather than through a multiannual programming process. This allows the EU to respond optimally to the rapidly changing environment.\nMore information on EU support is available from the\nDirectorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations\n.\nLibya in the Southern Neighbourhood\nThe EU established its privileged partnership with the Eastern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean back in 1995 with the launch of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership at the Barcelona Conference, aiming to establish an area of peace, stability and economic prosperity that upholds democratic values and human rights.\nThe 25\nth\nanniversary of the Barcelona Process in November 2020 was an opportunity to reflect on the strategic partnership with the region in light of the political, socioeconomic, financial and environmental challenges exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and to reassess the EU’s partnership with Libya and the other Southern Neighbourhood partner countries. Following consultations with partners, this reflection resulted in a Joint Communication by the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on\n‘A renewed partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood – A new Agenda for the Mediterranean\n’ and the annexed\n‘Economic and Investment Plan for the Southern Neighbours’\nin February 2021.\nWhile the\nEuropean Neighbourhood Policy\nalso covers Libya, due to the lack of an Association Agreement, there are no shared Partnership Priorities between the EU and Libya.\nMore information on the Southern Neighbourhood\nTrading with Libya\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Libya\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Libya\nExporting from the EU\nto Libya\nTrade defence measures in force in Libya\nTrade relations are part of\nthe EU's overall political and economic relations with Libya\nLibya is a\nmember of the World Trade Organization\n*\nThis designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue.\nShare this page",

In March 2024, the European Commission published its latest Staff Working Document on the implementation of the agreement. The\nreport\ndemonstrated that the agreement is being implemented smoothly and that it is delivering benefits for Western Sahara and its population in terms of exports, economic activity and employment.\nIn 2021, under the new\nEU Trade Policy Review\n, the EU has offered to discuss modernising trade and investment relations with Morocco, to better adapt them to today’s challenges.\nThe impact of the trade component of the EU's Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Morocco was assessed by the\nex-post evaluation\nof the trade chapters of the six Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia), which was published by the European Commission in 2021.\nFinancial support\nUnder the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2021-2027, the EU adopted a broad new financial cooperation instrument: the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument – Global Europe (NDICI-GE). The NDICI is the basis of EU-Morocco cooperation.\nThe EU committed €931 million to bilateral assistance for Morocco for the period 2021-2024, under the NDICI-GE).\nMorocco is one of the largest recipients of EU funds under the European Neighbourhood Policy. More information on EU support is available from the\nDirectorate-General for Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf\n(DG MENA).\nMorocco in the Southern Neighbourhood\nThe EU established its privileged partnership with the Eastern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean back in 1995 with the launch of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership at the Barcelona Conference, aiming to establish an area of peace, stability and economic prosperity that upholds democratic values and human rights.\nThe 25\nth\nanniversary of the Barcelona Process in November 2020 was an opportunity to reflect on the strategic partnership with the region in light of the political, socioeconomic, financial and environmental challenges exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and to reassess the EU’s partnership with Morocco and the other Southern Neighbourhood partner countries. Following consultations with partners, this reflection resulted in a Joint Communication by the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on\n‘A renewed partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood – A new Agenda for the Mediterranean\n’ and the annexed\n‘Economic and Investment Plan for the Southern Neighbours’\nin February 2021.\nMore information on the Southern Neighbourhood\nIn addition to the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, in 2004 Morocco signed the Agadir Agreement with Jordan, Egypt and Tunisia. The agreement committed all parties to removing all tariffs on trade between them and to harmonise their legislation with regard to standards and customs procedures. The Agadir Agreement entered into force in July 2006, and an Agadir Technical Unit in Amman ensures its implementation. Lebanon and Palestine joined the agreement in 2020.\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation and the PEM Convention on rules of origin\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation system of origin was created in 2005. It brings together the EU, Morocco, and other partners in Europe and the Mediterranean to support regional integration by creating a common system of rules of origin. Rules of origin are technical criteria which determine whether a specific product qualifies for duty-free or other preferential access under a given trade agreement.\nCumulation of origin means a product coming from one partner country can be processed or added to a product of a second partner country and still be considered an ‘originating product’ of that second partner country for the purposes of a particular trade agreement.\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean system allows for diagonal cumulation (i.e. cumulation between two or more countries) between the EU, EFTA countries, Türkiye, the Western Balkans, the Faroe Islands, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and any country that signed the Barcelona Declaration of 1995. The system was originally based on a network of Free Trade Agreements with identical origin protocols.\nThese individual origin protocols are being progressively replaced by a reference to the\nRegional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin\n(PEM Convention), which was established in 2011 to provide a more unified framework for origin protocols. Morocco acceded to the Regional Convention on 18 April 2012.\nCommittees and Dialogues\nThe EU and Morocco meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the Agreement.\nTechnical committee meetings - agendas and reports\nTrading with Morocco\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Morocco\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Morocco\nExporting from the EU\nto Morocco\nTrade defence measures in force in Morocco\nTrade relations are part of\nthe EU's overall political and economic relations with Morocco\nMorocco is a\nmember of the World Trade Organization\n*\nThis designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue.\nLatest news\nNews article\n14 March 2025\nCommission imposes duties on unfairly subsidised imports of aluminium road wheels from Morocco\nThe European Commission has imposed countervailing duties on imports of aluminium road wheels from Morocco, shielding EU producers and defending 16,600 jobs from unfair trading practices.\n1 min read\nNews article\n12 January 2023\nEU confirms duties on dumped imports of aluminium road wheels from Morocco\nThe Commission today imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of aluminium road wheels originating in Morocco.

In 2018, the EU entered into enhanced engagement under EBA with Myanmar, in view of assessing compliance with human rights and labour rights conventions.\nAfter the military coup on 1 February 2021, the EU has reassessed its engagement towards Myanmar and its response, based on the Council Conclusions of 22 February 2021.\nTrade picture\nTotal trade between the EU and Myanmar amounted to €3.7 billion in 2023.\nIn 2023, the EU ranked as Myanmar's third-biggest trade partner (after China at 26.4% and Thailand at 17.2), accounting for 11.1% of the country’s total trade. Myanmar was the EU’s 57\nth\nlargest trading partner (accounting for 0.1% of the EU’s total trade).\nIn 2023, the EU imported goods worth €3.4 billion from Myanmar. The key EU imports from Myanmar are dominated by garments and footwear. Other imports include manufactured goods and agricultural products.\nIn 2023, the EU exported goods worth €324 million to Myanmar. The key EU exports to Myanmar are dominated by chemicals, foodstuffs, machinery, and transport equipment.\nThe EU and Myanmar\nThe EU and Myanmar launched negotiations for an\ninvestment\nprotection agreement in 2014, which were since then put on hold.\nThe agreement would:\noffer investors from both sides a predictable and secure investment environment\nprotect them against discrimination\nensure they are treated in a fair and equitable way and\nensure that investments will not be unfairly taken away without fair compensation.\nA\nsustainability impact assessment\ncomplemented the negotiations. This evaluated the potential economic, social, environmental, and human rights impact of the future agreement.\nThe EU is committed to the conclusion of an ambitious investment protection agreement that will allow investors to benefit from the enhanced legal certainty and promote responsible investments from the EU to contribute to Myanmar's sustainable development. The negotiations were put on hold in 2017 as negotiations cannot happen in isolation of the broader context, in particular the EU’s serious concerns on human rights.\nAs a Least Developed Country (LDC), Myanmar benefits from the most favourable regime available under the EU's\nGeneralised Scheme of Preferences (GSP)\n, namely the Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme.\nThe EU’s GSP regulation allows vulnerable developing countries to pay fewer or no duties on exports to the EU, giving them vital access to the EU market and contributing to their growth. The EBA scheme is one arm of the GSP, which grants duty-free and quota-free access to the EU for all products (except arms and ammunition) for the world's Least Developed Countries, as defined by the United Nations.\nMyanmar benefits significantly from its preferential access to the EU market under the EBA. Main exports to the EU are textiles, footwear, rice and precious stones.\nOut of the total exports in 2020, about 98% were eligible to EBA preferential duties.\nThe GSP Regulation provides that trade preferences may be suspended in case of \"serious and systematic violation of principles\" laid down in the human rights and labour rights Conventions listed in Annex VIII of the Regulation.\nMyanmar and ASEAN\nMyanmar is one of the ten member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and one of its three LDCs.\nMore information on ASEAN\nTrading with Myanmar\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Myanmar\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Myanmar\nExporting from the EU\nto Myanmar\nTrade defence measures in force in Myanmar\nTrade relations are part of\nthe EU's overall political and economic relations with Myanmar\nMyanmar is a\nmember of the World Trade Organization\nShare this page",

The deficit in the trade of goods is mostly due to a shift in the import of gas away from Russia. 67.5% of Norwegian exports go to the EU.\nExports from the EU to Norway are dominated by machinery and appliances, as well as transport equipment, while mineral products represent around 53% of EU imports from Norway.  Norway is the biggest exporter of fish and aquaculture products to the EU.\nThe balance of trade in services between Norway and the EU is positive for the EU and rather stable.\nThe EU and Norway\nAs a member state of the\nEuropean Economic Area\n, Norway fully applies the whole EU\nacquis communautaire\nrelevant to the four freedoms (free movement of goods, persons, services and capital), along with that pertinent to flanking policies (i.e. transport, competition, social policy, consumer protection, environment, statistics and company law).\nAs a result, the EEA agreement provides for a high degree of economic integration, common competition rules, rules for state aid and government procurement.\nAgriculture and fisheries are not covered by the EEA agreement.

Enhancing bilateral trade and investment is also part of the\nEU-Pakistan 5-year Engagement Plan from 2012\n.\nPakistan is a major beneficiary of the trading opportunities offered by the\nEU Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP)\n. From 1 January 2014, Pakistan benefits from generous tariff preferences (mostly zero duties on two thirds of all product categories) under the so-called GSP+ arrangement aiming to support sustainable development and good governance. In order to maintain GSP+, Pakistan has to keep ratification and effectively implement 27 core international conventions on human and labour rights, environmental protection, and good governance.\nTrade picture\nThe EU is Pakistan's second most important trading partner, accounting for 15.3% of Pakistan's total trade in 2023.\nIn 2023, Pakistan was the EU's 47\nth\nlargest trading partner in goods, accounting for 0.2% of EU trade.\nPakistani exports to the EU are dominated by textiles and clothing, accounting for 73.2% of Pakistan's total exports to the EU in 2023.\nPakistan's imports from the EU are mainly comprised of machinery and transport equipment (23.9% in 2023) as well as chemicals (19.8% in 2023).\nPakistan is the largest beneficiary of the EU's GSP+ arrangement.\nThe EU and Pakistan\nThe EU and Pakistan have set up a Sub-Group on Trade to promote the development of two-way trade. The Sub-Group on Trade, set up under the auspices of the EU-Pakistan Joint Commission, is the forum for discussions on trade policy developments more broadly. It also aims to tackle individual market access issues which hamper trade between the two parties.\nWhile Pakistan's economy holds considerable potential, high costs of doing business, complex regulation and infrastructure bottlenecks all have a detrimental effect on trade and growth. Pakistan's trade regime and regulatory environment still remain comparatively restrictive.\nTextiles and clothing account for over 80% of Pakistan's exports to the EU. While the textiles and clothing industry are the backbone of Pakistani exports, relying so heavily on one product category carries risks for Pakistan. Trade diversification would play an essential role in this respect. The granting of GSP+ preferences in 2014 should stimulate Pakistan's efforts towards diversification.\nAs a result of GSP+, more than 78% of Pakistan's exports enter the EU at preferential rates.\nAround 80% of the textiles and clothing articles imported to the EU from Pakistan enter the EU at a preferential tariff rate. Around a quarter of these imports are bed linen, table linen and toilet and kitchen linen.\nPakistan's trade preferences\nThe EU supports Pakistan's integration into the world economy and its sustainable economic development by granting it GSP+ trade preferences.\nThanks to GSP+ more than 76% of Pakistan's exports, including textiles and clothing, enter the EU duty and quota free. This represents almost 20% of Pakistan's exports globally. The GSP+ preferences should also help Pakistan diversify its export basket.\nIn order to maintain GSP+ Pakistan has to keep ratification and effectively implement 27 core international conventions on human and labour rights, environmental protection and good governance.

The agreement provides for duty-free access to EU markets for Palestinian industrial goods, and a phase-out of tariffs on EU exports to Palestine* over five years. An agreement for further liberalisation of agricultural products, processed agricultural products and fish and fishery products entered into force on 1 January 2012. The latter agreement initially applied for 10 years, but it was extended for an additional 10 years in 2021.\nTrade picture\nDue to the difficult economic situation and restrictions on movement and access to Palestine*, trade with the EU is very limited (Palestine* was the EU’s 159\nth\nbiggest trade partner in 2022).\nTotal trade in goods between the EU and Palestine* in 2022 amounted to €444 million.\nThe EU’s imports from Palestine* are generally very low. In 2022, they were worth only €25 million and mainly consisted of vegetal products (€17 million, 68%), and animal or vegetable fats and oils (€5 million, 20%).\nThe EU’s exports to Palestine* amounted to €419 million in 2022. They were led by transport equipment (€149 million, 33.2%).\nThe EU and Palestine*\nThe\nEuropean Neighbourhood Policy\nis part of the European Union’s response to the Palestinian Authority’s political and economic reform agenda. Palestinian participation in the European Neighbourhood Policy takes place in the context of the overall political situation in the region, which affects the scope of feasible action. There are various constraints and limitations resulting from the on-going Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the continuing occupation, including settlement activity, and restrictions to movement resulting from the closure policy and the separation barrier.\nThe EU works closely with Israel and other Southern Mediterranean partners to improve Palestinian* access to European and international markets.\nPalestine in the Southern Neighbourhood\nPalestine* is one of the partners of the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine*, Syria and Tunisia). The EU established its privileged partnership with the countries of the Eastern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean back in 1995 with the launch of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership at the Barcelona Conference, aiming to establish an area of peace, stability and economic prosperity that upholds democratic values and human rights.\nThe 25\nth\nanniversary of the Barcelona Process in November 2020 was an opportunity to reflect on the strategic partnership with the region in light of the political, socioeconomic, financial and environmental challenges exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and to reassess the EU’s partnership with Palestine* and other Southern Neighbourhood partner countries.

The EU’s bilateral assistance under the ENI focused on the following priority sectors: (i) governance reform, fiscal consolidation and policy; (ii) rule of law, justice, citizens’ safety and human rights; (iii) sustainable service delivery; (iv) access to self-sufficient water and energy services; and; (v) sustainable economic development.\nUnder the EU's Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2021-2027, the EU adopted a broad new financial cooperation instrument: the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI). The NDICI is the basis of EU-Palestinian cooperation.\nMore information on EU support is available from the\nDirectorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations\n.\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation and the PEM Convention on rules of origin\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation system of origin was created in 2005. It brings together the EU, Palestine*, and other partners in Europe and the Mediterranean to support regional integration by creating a common system of rules of origin. Rules of origin are technical criteria which determine whether a specific product qualifies for duty-free or other preferential access under a given trade agreement.\nCumulation of origin means a product coming from one partner country can be processed or added to a product of a second partner country and still be considered an ‘originating product’ of that second partner country for the purposes of a particular trade agreement.\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean system allows for diagonal cumulation (i.e. cumulation between two or more countries) between the EU, EFTA countries, Turkey, the Western Balkans, the Faroe Islands, Ukraine, Moldova and any country that signed the Barcelona Declaration of 1995. The system was originally based on a network of Free Trade Agreements with identical origin protocols.\nThese individual origin protocols are being progressively replaced by a reference to the\nRegional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin\n(PEM Convention), which was established in 2011 to provide a more unified framework for origin protocols. Palestine acceded to the PEM Convention on 1 July 2014. Products originating in the Israeli settlements in Palestine* (the West Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights) are not entitled to benefit from the preferential tariff treatment under the EU-Israel Association Agreement.\nMore information on Mediterranean preferential Rules of Origin\nCommittees and Dialogues\nThe EU and Palestine* meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the Agreement.\nTechnical committee meetings - agendas and reports\nTrading with Palestine*\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Palestine*\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Palestine*\nExporting from the EU\nto Palestine*\nTrade defence measures in force in Palestine\n*\nTrade relations are part of\nthe EU's overall political and economic relations with Palestine\n*\n*\nThis designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of EU Member States on this issue.\nShare this page",

        "description": "Country or region\nParaguay\nMercosur\nTrade topics\nNegotiations and agreements\nTrade policy\nThe relations between the EU and Paraguay are governed by the\nFramework Cooperation Agreement\nsigned in 1992.\nThe follow-up of this agreement entails regular meetings of the EU-Paraguay Joint Commission, including on trade matters. This Commission meets normally every 2 years, most recently in May 2021.  As a member of Mercosur, Paraguay is also a party to the EU-Mercosur Framework Co-operation Agreement signed in 1995, which includes provisions on trade cooperation.\nParaguay participated fully in the negotiation of an EU-\nMercosur\nAssociation Agreement.\nTrade picture\nTrade and investment between the EU and Paraguay are at relatively modest levels. Bilateral trade in 2020 was worth about €1 billion. EU imports from Paraguay have decreased since 2018 from around €648 million to €417 million in 2020.  EU exports to Paraguay declined slightly over the same period, from €653 million to €592 million.\nIn 2020, the EU was Paraguay's fourth most important trading partner (after Brazil, China and Argentina), accounting for 5.5% of Paraguay’s total trade. EU imports from Paraguay are dominated by agricultural products (85% of total imports from Paraguay into the EU in 2020).\nEU exports to Paraguay are dominated by manufactured products, in particular machinery and transport equipment (37%) and chemicals (20%) (2020 data).\nThe EU is an important investor in Paraguay. EU Foreign Direct Investment stocks in Paraguay increased were of the value of €900 million in 2019.\nEU exports of services to Paraguay were of approximately €200 million in 2019, while Paraguay exported services to the EU worth approximately €100 million.\nThe EU and Paraguay\nThe Framework Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement is managed through periodic meetings of the EU-Paraguay Joint Cooperation Committee, including one part on trade matters. The last Joint Cooperation Committee meeting was held in May 2021.\nAlthough EU-Paraguay trade remains modest in absolute terms, as a member of Mercosur Paraguay is part of an important trading partner for the EU in Latin America. Furthermore, Paraguay has relatively sound public finance and a good growth potential, with IMF estimating a growth rate of 4% in 2021, which makes it attractive for foreign investment.\nThe EU attaches importance to the fight against illegal trade in pirated goods in the tri-border area between Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil and considers the respect of intellectual property rights a priority. The EU is cooperating with Paraguay in this respect.\nParaguay no longer qualifies for preferential trade treatment under the EU GSP scheme due to its upper middle income status and was removed from the list of GSP beneficiary countries as of 1 January 2019.\nParaguay and foreign investment\nAccess to other Mercosur markets plays an important role in the attractiveness of Paraguay as a destination of Foreign Direct Investment.\nParaguay in Mercosur\nParaguay is as a member of Mercosur. As a member of Mercosur Paraguay participated fully in the  negotiation of the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement.\nThis Agreement should provide a boost to regional trade integration among the countries of Mercosur and stimulate new opportunities for trade to and from the EU by removing tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade.\nMore information on Mercosur\nCommittees and Dialogues\nThe EU and Paraguay meet once every two years to discuss the Framework Cooperation Agreement.\nTechnical committee meetings - agendas and reports\nTrading with Paraguay\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Paraguay\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Paraguay\nExporting from the EU\nto Paraguay\nTrade defence measures in force in Paraguay\nTrade relations are part of\nthe EU's overall political and economic relations with Paraguay\nParaguay is a\nmember of the World Trade Organization\nLatest news\nPress release\n6 December 2024\nEU and Mercosur reach political agreement on groundbreaking partnership\nToday, the EU and four Mercosur countries finalised negotiations for an EU-Mercosur partnership agreement.\n1 min read\nStatement\n7 December 2023\nEU-Mercosur Joint Press Statement\nThe EU and Mercosur are engaged in constructive discussions with a view to finalising the pending issues within the Association Agreement.\n1 min read\nNews article\n8 March 2023\nMeeting of the European Union-Mercosur chief negotiators\nJoint communiqué of the European Union and Mercosur.\n1 min read\nAll the latest news on EU trade\nFinland - Giving Argentinians a taste of traditional Finnish brewing\nThe company sees growing demand for its types of beer in South America, and especially in Argentina, and would like to launch exports there.

The second round of negotiations between the EU and the Philippines took place in February 2017, but the talks were then put on hold.

Co-operation is maintained through the EU-ASEAN Dialogue, which includes discussions on trade and investment issues at ministerial and senior economic official level.\nEnsuring better access for EU exporters to the dynamic ASEAN market is a priority for the EU.

        "description": "Country or region\nRussia\nTrade topics\nNegotiations and agreements\nTrade policy\nFollowing Russia's unprovoked and unjustified military invasion of Ukraine, the EU has imposed sanctions on Russia. Details can be found here:\nEU restrictive measures in response to Russia’s military aggression in Ukraine\nUntil 24 February 2022, Russia was one of the main trade partners of the European Union.\nSince 1997, the EU's political and economic relations with Russia have been based on a bilateral\nPartnership and Cooperation Agreement\n(PCA). The trade-relevant sections of the PCA aim to promote trade and investment, as well as to develop mutually beneficial economic relations.\nSince 2012, when Russia joined the WTO, EU-Russia trade relations have also been framed by WTO multilateral rules.\nSince 2014, the illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia and its destabilising role in eastern Ukraine have seriously affected EU-Russia relations. As a result, some of the policy dialogues and mechanisms of cooperation, including in the area of trade, have been suspended.\nFollowing further Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the European Union has adopted unprecedented measures that aim to significantly weaken Russia's economic base, depriving it of critical technologies and markets, and thereby significantly curtailing its ability to wage war.\nTrade picture\nPlease note that the following figures reflect the situation in 2021, before recent trade-related sanctions began to have an effect.\nIn 2021, Russia was the EU's fifth largest trade partner, representing 5.8% of the EU’s total trade in goods with the world.\nIn 2020, the EU was Russia's first trade partner, accounting for 37.3% of the country’s total trade in goods with the world. 36.5% of Russia’s imports came from the EU and 37.9% of its exports went to the EU.\nIn 2021, the total trade in goods between the EU and Russia amounted to €257.5 billion. The EU’s imports were worth €158.5 billion and were dominated by fuel and mining products – especially mineral fuels (€98.9 billion, 62%), wood (€3.16 billion, 2.0%), iron and steel (€7.4 billion, 4.7%), and fertilisers (1.78 bn, 1.1%). The EU’s exports in 2021 totalled €99.0 billion. They were led by machinery and equipment (€19.5 billion, 19.7%), motor vehicles (€8.95 billion, 9%), pharmaceuticals (€8.1 billion, 8.1%), electrical equipment and machinery (€7.57 billion, 7.6%), and plastics (€4.38 billion, 4.3%).\nTwo-way trade in services between the EU and Russia in 2020 amounted to €29.4 billion, with EU imports of services from Russia representing €8.9 billion and exports of services to Russia accounting for €20.5 billion.\nIn 2019, the EU was the largest investor in Russia. The EU foreign direct investment (FDI) outward stock in Russia amounted to €311.4 billion, while Russia’s FDI stock in the EU was estimated at €136 billion.\nThe EU and Russia\nThe 1997 PCA remains the general framework for EU-Russia trade relations. Negotiations for a New EU-Russia Agreement started in 2008, but were put on hold in 2010 owing to the lack of progress in the Trade and Investment Chapter. In March 2014, the European Council suspended the negotiations due to the Russian military intervention in Ukraine.\nRussia’s accession to the WTO in 2012 raised the expectations that trade with Russia would benefit from sustained liberalisation. Instead, Russia has progressively put in place numerous measures favouring domestic products and services over foreign ones, and incentivising localisation of production in Russia by foreign companies.\nThis\nimport substitution policy\nhas been continually expanded. As a result, EU exporters have either been pushed out of the market or been obliged to relocate production to Russia. Related measures often contravene  WTO rules and cause many trade irritants. Some of these have triggered WTO dispute settlement procedures:\nThe EU has filed six disputes against Russia at the WTO: on wood export restrictions (DS608; 2022), on which consultations took place in January 2022; on restrictions to procurement by state-owned enterprises (DS604; 2021), where the panel's authority lapsed on 8 March 2023; on Russia's excessive import duties (DS485; 2014) and on Russia's anti-dumping duties on light commercial vehicles (DS479; 2014) – in cases DS479 and DS485, Russia implemented the Dispute Settlement Body’s recommendations, which were favourable to the EU; on Russia's embargo on EU pig meat on the basis of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) requirements (DS475; 2014) – the authority of the compliance panel lapsed in January 2021; and on Russia's recycling fee on imported motor vehicles (DS462; 2013) – the case is currently on hold.\nRussia has also filed four disputes at the WTO against the EU: on the EU's third energy package (DS476; 2014), on gas cost-adjustment in EU anti-dumping investigations (DS474; 2013, and DS 494; 2015), and on EU anti-dumping measures on imports of certain cold-rolled flat steel products from Russia (DS 521; 2017). All four disputes are ongoing.\nIn July 2014, in response to Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine, the EU adopted a set of\nrestrictive measures\nagainst Russia targeting four economic sectors: access to finance, arms, dual-use goods and specific technologies for oil production and exploration.\nIn August 2014, Russia reacted by introducing a political ban on imports of a range of EU agricultural and food products. The product scope was further extended in October 2017. More information is available\nhere\n.\nIn February 2022, following further military aggression in Ukraine by Russia, the EU adopted\nadditional sanctions\ntargeting the energy, transport, technology and financial sectors, as well as imposing restrictive measures on individuals.\nIn addition, as of 15 March, the EU, in collaboration with\nthe G7 countries\nand other like-minded partners, stopped treating Russia as a\nMost-Favoured-Nation within the WTO framework\n. This deprives Russia of key trade advantages as a WTO member.\nThe Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU)\nIn 2010, Russia created a Customs Union with Kazakhstan and Belarus. This Customs Union became the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) in 2015. Armenia and Kyrgyzstan joined the EAEU the same year. Russia represents almost 90% of the EAEU’s GDP.\nThe EAEU has legal competence in policy areas such as customs, competition, trade defence, agricultural and industrial product regulation, intellectual property rights and foreign trade. At the same time, semi-uniform EAEU technical regulations lack enforcement mechanisms and create additional barriers for trade.\nThe Commission maintained a technical dialogue with the executive branch of the EAEU – Eurasian Economic Commission – until Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nTrading with Russia\nTrade with Russia is heavily restricted by EU sanctions.

After the European Parliament gave its consent to the two agreements on 13 February 2019, the EUSFTA entered into force on 21 November 2019. The EUSIPA will enter into force once it has been ratified by all EU Member States.\nOn 25 July 2024, the EU and Singapore\nconcluded negotiations\nfor a digital trade agreement (EUSDTA).

The negotiations resulted in a Free Trade Agreement (EUSFTA) and an Investment Protection Agreement (EUSIPA).\nKey elements\nof the EUSFTA include the elimination of all remaining tariffs on products while opening new opportunities for service providers in sectors like telecommunications, environmental services, engineering, computing, and maritime transport. The EUSFTA includes ambitious provisions in the field of government procurement, intellectual property (including Geographical Indications), sanitary and phytosanitary measures, customs, rules of origin, renewable energies, and sustainable development.\nThe EUSIPA ensures high levels of investment protection, while allowing the EU and Singapore to regulate public policy objectives like health, safety, and the environment. It creates a modern framework for private and public investments and introduces a balanced Investment Court System for resolving investment disputes. Both agreements were signed on 19 October 2019, making them the first of their kind to have been concluded between the EU and a Southeast Asian country.\nIn July 2023, the EU and Singapore decided to bring their long-standing and robust economic partnership into the digital domain by\nlaunching negotiations\non a digital trade agreement (EUSDTA). The agreement aims to build consumer trust, ensure predictability and legal certainty for businesses, and remove and prevent the emergence of unjustified barriers to\ndigital trade\n. It also ensures that the EU and Singapore preserve policy space to develop and implement the policies required to address new challenges in the digital economy.

The agreement provisionally entered into force on 10 October 2016.\nUnder the EU-SADC EPA, the EU fully or partially removed customs duties on 97.8% of imports from South Africa in 2022, while guaranteeing full free access for the rest of the signatory countries.\nUntil the application of the EU-SADC EPA, trade relations between the EU and South Africa had been governed by the trade chapter of the\nTrade, Development and Cooperation Agreement\n(TDCA) concluded in 1999. The trade-related provisions of the TDCA were replaced by the EU-SADC EPA.\nTrade picture\nEU-South Africa trade and investment has been increasing steadily since the EU-SADC EPA began to be applied. Since 2016, EU-South Africa trade has increased by 42% (EU imports have risen by 65% and EU exports have gone up by 26%).\nSouth Africa is the EU's biggest trading partner in Sub-Saharan Africa, with €49.5 billion of total trade in goods in 2023.\nThe EU is the largest source of foreign direct investment in South Africa – almost half of South Africa's FDI stocks originate in the EU.\nThe automotive sector provides an example of successful diversification of South African exports and the creation of value chains with high-value addition in South Africa. Between 2016 and 2023, the EU’s automotive imports from South Africa increased by 64% and its automotive exports went up by 15%.

It helps to boost bilateral and regional trade, thereby providing new opportunities to fulfil the objectives of the\nSouth Africa-EU Strategic Partnership\n.\nEU-based companies invest in a wide range of economic activities in South Africa and are major contributors to the country’s industrialisation and transformation agenda.\nFollowing the termination of most Bilateral Investment Treaties with EU countries, South Africa adopted a\nProtection of Investment Act\nin 2015.

The FTA was the EU’s first with an Asian country and the first to include a chapter on trade and sustainable development.\nTo complement the FTA, the EU and the Republic of Korea\nlaunched negotiations\nfor a digital trade agreement on 31 October 2023, building on the EU-Republic of Korea Digital Trade Principles agreed in 2022. The two sides intend to agree on a set of ambitious, modern digital trade rules, building on and complementing the existing preferential trade framework.\n*\nCovering the territory of the Republic of Korea, commonly known as South Korea\n.\nEU-South Korea agreements\nEU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement | Digital Trade Agreement\nIn place | Being negotiated\nTrade picture\nThe Republic of Korea is the EU's 8\nth\nlargest trade partner in goods, whereas the EU is Korea's 3\nrd\nlargest trade partner in goods.\nSince the entry into force of the FTA on 1 July 2011, bilateral trade and investment have expanded remarkably. Total bilateral trade in goods amounted to ca. €130 billion in 2023, up by 106% from 2011 (ca. €63 billion).\nBilateral trade in goods remains highly concentrated on industrial products, which represented 96% of such trade in 2023, including machinery and mechanical appliances (32%), transportation equipment (21%), and chemical products (18%).\nBilateral trade in agricultural and fishery products has gradually increased, accounting for just below 4% in 2023. Of EU exports to Korea, the share of agricultural and fishery products is at just below 9% in 2023.\nBilateral trade in services increased by 63% between 2012 and 2022, amounting to ca. €31 billion in 2022 (latest available data). In 2022, trade in services remained concentrated on several services including transport (41%); other business services (19%); as well as telecommunications, computer and information services (11%).\nThe EU remains the Republic of Korea's biggest foreign direct investor, with an FDI stock of €54 billion (2022), ahead of Japan and the United States. Among EU Member States, the Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg are the largest investors in 2022, with financial, insurance and other professional services attracting significant investments. Korean investments into the EU have also grown and reached €40.6 billion in 2022: about ¾ of the volume of EU outward stocks. Korean investments are particularly focused on the electric vehicles sector, with Hungary, Poland and Germany being the largest investment destinations in 2022.\nThe EU and the Republic of Korea\nThe Republic of Korea is one of the most dynamic economies in the world, with a GDP of about €1.5 trillion. It ranks as the 13\nth\nlargest economy in the world and the 4\nth\nlargest economy in Asia. Additionally, the Republic of Korea is a highly successful economy at the technological forefront, spending 4.9% of its GDP on R&D, ahead of the EU at 2.3%. This is reflected in the country’s industrial strengths, which include high-tech and R&D intensive products such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, consumer electronics,  and the shipbuilding and automotive sectors, including EV batteries.\nIn 2023, the Republic of Korea’s bilateral trade in goods with the EU reached ca. €130 billion, up by 106% from 2011 when the FTA was first applied. The FTA removed the majority of import duties in 2011, with those remaining removed after five years on 1 July 2016 – with the exception of duties on a limited number of agricultural products.\nThe agreement also addresses non-tariff barriers to trade, specifically in the automotive, pharmaceutical, medical devices and electronics sectors. The FTA has also created new opportunities for market access in services and investments, and includes provisions in areas such as competition policy, government procurement, intellectual property rights, and transparency in regulation.\nRegarding the implementation of the FTA, progress has been made with regard to the Republic of Korea’s recognition of the EU’s regionalisation measures to control outbreaks of African swine fever and the highly pathogenic avian influenza in 2022.\nAdditionally, and following continuous engagement between the EU, Member States, and the Republic of Korea, the Korean government abolished local content requirements in the offshore wind energy sector, which had allowed for higher prices for windfarms that have a minimum of 50% domestic components. Meanwhile, the EU continues to closely follow developments in the sector advocating for predictability and transparency of the permission process and auction rounds.\nMore on the implementation of the FTA\nThe Commission's\nannual reports on the implementation of FTAs\ncontain a section on the Republic of Korea.\nFactsheet:\nEU-Korea FTA: a quick reading guide\nFactsheet:\n10 key benefits of the EU-Korea FTA\nThe FTA is also the first such agreement of the EU that includes a chapter on trade and sustainable development (TSD). The chapter reaffirms the commitment of both parties to contribute to sustainable development, with binding provisions upholding and promoting social and environmental standards.\nFollowing the activation of the bilateral dispute resolution mechanism under this chapter, the Republic of Korea is in the process of amending its labour laws in the context of ratifying International Labour Organisation Conventions.\nMore on sustainable development (including dispute settlement) in the EU-Korea FTA\nTo complement the FTA, the EU and the Republic of Korea\nlaunched negotiations\nfor a Digital Trade Agreement on 31 October 2023, building on the EU-Republic of Korea Digital Trade Principles agreed in 2022. The two sides intend to agree on a set of ambitious, modern digital trade rules, building on and complementing the existing preferential trade framework.\nBeyond trade, in 2010, the EU and the Republic of Korea upgraded their broader relationship to a Strategic Partnership. On 10 May 2010 the two sides signed a Framework Agreement, which entered into force on 1 June 2014. The agreement provides a basis for strengthened cooperation on major political and global issues such as human rights, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, counter-terrorism, climate change, and energy security.\nCommittees and Dialogues\nTo ensure full implementation, the FTA established a number of specialised committees and working groups between the two parties. These bodies also provide an opportunity to seek resolutions to market access concerns and to engage in closer regulatory cooperation. They report to the annual Trade Committee between the EU and the Republic of Korea at ministerial level, which ensures the FTA’s proper operation.\nTechnical committee meetings - agendas and reports\nTrading with the Republic of Korea\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Korea\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Korea\nExporting from the EU\nto Korea\nTrade defence measures in force in Korea\nTrade relations are part of\nthe EU's overall political and economic relations with the Republic of Korea\nThe Republic of Korea is a\nmember of the World Trade Organization\nEvaluation of the Free Trade Agreement between the EU and the Republic of Korea\nExporters' stories\nAustria - Exports help Austrian climbing equipment maker reach the summit\nThe 2011 EU-South Korea trade deal eliminated customs duties enabling AustiAlpin, a climbing equipment maker, to start doing business there.

South Africa's exports to the EU are much diversified and range from fruit to platinum and from manufactured goods to wine.\nThe EU exports a wide range of goods to the Southern African Development Community EPA countries, including vehicles, machinery, electrical equipment, pharmaceuticals and processed food.\nThe countries in the Southern African Development Community EPA Group are members of the WTO.\nThe SADC EPA group are very diverse in terms of economic development: Lesotho and Mozambique are least developed countries (LDCs), but Namibia and Botswana hold upper middle income status.

They can shield sensitive products from full liberalisation and safeguards can be deployed when imports from the EU are growing too quickly. A detailed development chapter identifies trade-related areas that can benefit from funding. The agreement also contains a chapter on sustainable development which covers social and environmental matters.\nImproved opportunities for trade in goods\nThe EPA guarantees access to the EU market without any duties or quotas for Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, and Eswatini. South Africa benefits from new market access in comparison to the\nTrade, Development and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and South Africa\n(TDCA), whichthat currently governeds the trade relations with the EU until October 2016 (when the EPA entered into provisional application and thereby repealed the trade component of the TDCA). The new access includes better trading terms mainly in agriculture and fisheries, including for wine, sugar, fisheries products, flowers and canned fruits. The EU will obtain meaningful new market access into the Southern African Customs Union (products include wheat, barley, cheese, meat products and butter), and will have the security of a bilateral agreement with Mozambique, one of the LDCs in the region.\nGeographical indications\nThe EPA includes a bilateral protocol between the EU and South Africa on the protection of geographical indications and on trade in wines and spirits. The EU will protect names such as Rooibos, the famous infusion from South Africa, and numerous wine names like Stellenbosch and Paarl.

In 2023, our bilateral trade in goods reached €327 billion, accounting for 6.4% of the EU’s total trade in goods.\nSwiss merchandise exports to the EU are concentrated in a few sectors, particularly chemicals/pharma and medical products (€65.3 billion, 45.4%), machinery and appliances (€18.4 billion, 13.2%), optical and photographic instruments (€14.5 billion, 10.4%), and pearls and precious metals (€12.2 billion, 8.8%).\nSwitzerland is a very important partner of the EU for trade in services, in particular for commercial services. In 2023, total bilateral trade in services reached €245 billion.\nBoth the EU and Switzerland are among each other's top destinations for foreign investment.\nThe EU and Switzerland\nRelations between the EU and Switzerland are governed by a series of bilateral agreements. The cornerstone of EU-Swiss trade relations is the\nFree Trade Agreement of 1972\n.\nAs a consequence of the rejection by Switzerland of membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) in 1992, Switzerland and the EU agreed on a package of seven\nsectoral agreements\nsigned in 1999 (known in Switzerland as 'Bilaterals I'). Some of these are relevant from a trade perspective:\nThe\nFree Movement of Persons\nAgreement\nallows for the provision of services, limited in time.\nThe\nMutual Recognition Agreement in relation to\nconformity assessment\nensures that, in twenty regulated sectors, the conformity assessment provided by one party is recognised by the other, which facilitates trade between the parties.\nThe\nPublic Procurement Agreement\nbuilds on the WTO Government Procurement Agreement.\nThe\nAgreement on trade in\nagricultural products\nincludes sanitary and phytosanitary rules, as well as tariffs and tariff rate quotas for agricultural products, except for cheese that is fully liberalised.\nA\nProtocol on\nprocessed agricultural products\n(Protocol 2), which was added to the Free Trade Agreement in 2005. It includes a mechanism whereby in practice Switzerland receives compensation for the very significant price differential of basic agricultural products – which serve as inputs to processed agricultural products – between the EU and Switzerland.\nA further set of\nsectoral agreements\nwas signed in 2004 (known as 'Bilaterals II'), covering, inter alia, Switzerland's participation in the Schengen area and Dublin asylum system, and agreements on taxation of savings, processed agricultural products, statistics, combating fraud, participation in the EU Media Programme and the European Environment Agency.\nIn their first decade of existence, the EU became aware of various structural problems with the bilateral agreements. In 2014, the EU and Switzerland therefore set out to negotiate an Institutional Framework Agreement (IFA) intended to provide solutions for all existing and future internal market access agreements. The IFA aimed to restructure EU-Swiss trade relations, notably by providing crucial rules and procedures for the dynamic takeover and homogenous application of internal market law, for enforcement of state aid rules, and dispute settlement.\nFollowing the breakdown of the negotiations on the Institutional Framework Agreement in May 2021, the EU’s aim has been to find a systemic solution to the structural governance issues based on the principle of non-discrimination between citizens and a level playing field between companies.\nIn November 2023, after 18 months of exploratory talks, the Commission and the Swiss authorities reached a\nCommon Understanding\non a broad package of measures to address the structural issues across the various agreements covered by the IFA, as well as any other internal market-related agreements that the EU and Switzerland may negotiate in future. Based on this package, both the Swiss Federal Council and the Council of the European Union adopted negotiating directives in March 2024. The formal negotiation process on this new package was launched on 18 March 2024 and completed on 20 December 2024. Over 200 negotiating meetings were held to reach an agreement.

At the outbreak of war in 2011, the EU suspended all its bilateral cooperation with the Government of Syria.\nTrade picture\nWith the EU implementing restrictive measures, bilateral trade volumes have decreased substantially over the years. In 2020, total trade in goods between the EU and Syria amounted to €393 million.\nThe EU is Syria’s biggest trade partner, representing 8.7% of the country’s total trade in goods with the world in 2020. Syria ranks as the EU’s 136\nth\nlargest trade partner.\nThe EU’s imports from Syria in 2020 were worth €61 million. They were dominated by agriculture and raw materials (€47 million, 77%).\nThe EU’s exports to Syria amounted to €332 million. They were dominated by agriculture and raw materials (€107 million, 32.2%), chemicals (€86 million, 25.9%) and machinery and transport equipment (€62 million, 18.7%).\nTwo-way trade in services totalled €642 million in 2019, with EU imports of services representing €507 million and exports €135 million.\nThe EU and Syria\nBilateral EU-Syria relations are governed by the\nCooperation Agreement\nsigned in 1977. However, this was suspended in 2011 for trade in crude oil, petroleum products, gold, precious metals and diamonds.\nSyria and the EU have negotiated an Association Agreement. However, the EU put its signature on hold due to the internal situation in Syria. In the meantime, the legal texts of the Agreement have become obsolete.\nFollowing the violent internal repression in Syria, in May 2011 the EU adopted\nrestrictive measures\ntowards Syria, which have had an impact on bilateral trade. These include an import ban on crude oil and petroleum products, and export restrictions on dual-use goods, key equipment and technology for the oil and gas industry, as well as on certain telecoms equipment and luxury goods.\nRestrictive measures implemented by the EU also concern the financial and transport sectors, and the financing of certain enterprises and infrastructure projects in Syria. The EU has frozen funds and economic resources of persons and entities supporting and/or benefitting from the Syrian regime.\nRegular trade and export of food, medical equipment or medicines is not subject to EU sanctions.\nSyria applied for\nWTO membership\nin October 2001. On 4 May 2010, the WTO General Council established a Working Party to examine Syria’s request for WTO membership. However, the Working Party is yet to meet.\nFinancial support\nThe EU and its Member States are collectively the largest provider of international aid in response to the Syrian crisis. Since the start of the conflict in 2011, they have mobilised over €24.8 billion to help the affected Syrian population, both inside the country and in the region.\nThe EU also mobilised over €1.2 billion of humanitarian assistance in 2014-2020.\n€327.6 million was mobilised inside Syria through the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI), to address the population’s medium and long-term needs.\nTo further increase financial assistance, the EU has also organised five international donor conferences for Syria since 2017.\nUnder the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2021-2027, the EU will adopt a broad new financial cooperation instrument: the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI). The NDICI will frame EU’s cooperation during this period.\nThe EU’s cooperation focuses on strengthening the population’s resilience and supporting post-conflict recovery.

In June 2022, these consultations were upgraded to the EU-Taiwan Trade and Investment Dialogue, co-chaired by the director-general of DG TRADE and Taiwan’s minister of economic affairs.\nThe second such Trade and Investment Dialogue was held in April 2023. Discussions focused on priority sectors including offshore wind and agri-food, digital trade facilitation measures, and security-related aspects of trade and investment.\nTaiwan, under the designation of the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei), joined the WTO in January 2002. In December 2008, Taiwan fulfilled an important WTO accession commitment by joining the WTO's\nGovernment Procurement Agreement\n.\nThis marked a significant milestone in Taiwan’s participation in the global trading system, including in the setting up of open, transparent, and non-discriminatory rules in the public procurement markets.\nTaiwan is also an active participant in plurilateral initiatives in the framework of the WTO, where it has a number of shared interests with the EU.\nTrade picture\nTaiwan was the EU’s 13\nth\nbiggest trading partner in 2023. Its total goods trade with the EU 27 reached €77.7 billion. EU exports to Taiwan and EU imports from Taiwan amounted to €30.5 billion and €47.8 billion respectively.\nThe EU currently runs a €17.3 billion trade deficit with Taiwan.\nThe EU is Taiwan's 4\nth\nlargest trading partner after China, the USA and Japan.\nThe EU’s largest export categories to Taiwan are semiconductor machinery (21% of total goods exports in 2023), passenger cars (12%), integrated circuits (10%), and pharmaceuticals (6%).\nEU imports from Taiwan are dominated by information and communication technology products. The largest categories are integrated circuits (microchips, etc.), which accounted for 23% of EU goods imports from Taiwan in 2023, computers and their parts (accounting for 21%), and phones (7%).\nThere are few trade and investment barriers, and Taiwan is an open economy. However, there are some sectors in which EU companies face market access difficulties, notably in relation to offshore wind power, where EU companies are required to implement stringent local content requirements. In the agriculture sector, EU exports are affected by cumbersome rules and regulations, including slow market access approvals, preventing bilateral trade from realising its full potential.\nThe EU and Taiwan\nWhile the EU pursues its 'One China' policy and recognises the government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, the EU and Taiwan have developed solid relations and close cooperation in a wide range of areas.\nFour technical working groups deal with issues relating to intellectual property rights, investment, technical barriers to trade, and sanitary and phytosanitary rules.\nThe EU in Taiwan\nThe European Commission established a\nEuropean Economic and Trade Office\nin Taipei in 2003.\nSince 1988, the\nEuropean Chamber of Commerce Taipei\nhas represented the interests of EU business in Taiwan, with 30 established sector committees to date.\nTrading with Taiwan\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Taiwan\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Taiwan\nExporting from the EU\nto Taiwan\nTrade defence measures in force in Taiwan\nTrade relations are part of\nthe EU's overall political and economic relations with Taiwan\nTaiwan is a\nmember of the World Trade Organization\nLatest news\nNews article\n17 December 2024\nEU and Taiwan hold third Trade and Investment Dialogue\nThe EU and Taiwan held the third Trade and Investment Dialogue (TID) on 17 December, taking stock of their bilateral trade and investment relationship.\n1 min read\nNews article\n8 November 2024\nEU and Taiwan reach understanding on WTO dispute over Taiwan’s offshore wind auctions\nThe EU and Taiwan have reached an understanding on the WTO dispute over Taiwan’s offshore wind auctions, outlining terms to address the EU's concerns about unfair treatment of imported goods and services.\n1 min read\nNews article\n26 July 2024\nEU challenges Taiwan’s discriminatory rules on offshore wind projects\nThe EU has today requested dispute settlement consultations at the WTO concerning Taiwan’s use of local content criteria for offshore wind energy projects.\n1 min read\nAll the latest news on EU trade\nShare this page",

        "description": "Country or region\nTunisia\nTrade topics\nNegotiations and agreements\nTrade policy\nThe EU and Tunisia have close and long-standing trade relations. Tunisia was the first partner in the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine*, Syria and Tunisia) to sign and implement an Association Agreement with the EU. The EU is the biggest foreign investor in Tunisia, accounting for 85% of the foreign direct investment (FDI) stock in the country.\nTrade picture\nThe EU is Tunisia's largest trade partner, accounting for 56% of its trade in 2023: 72% of Tunisia's exports went to the EU and 43.8% of Tunisia's imports came from the EU. Tunisia is the EU’s 34\nth\nbiggest trade partner, representing 0.5% of the EU’s total trade with the world in 2022.\nTotal trade in goods between the EU and Tunisia in 2023 amounted to €24.8 billion. The EU's imports from Tunisia amounted to €13 billion and mostly comprised machinery and appliances (€4.6 billion, 35.4%), and textiles (€2.7 billion, 20.6%). The EU's exports to Tunisia amounted to €11.6 billion and were dominated by machinery and appliances (€3.4 billion, 28.7%), followed by textiles (€1.6 billion, 13.4%) and base metals and articles thereof (€1.1 billion, 9.6%).\nTwo-way trade in services amounted to €4.8 billion in 2022, with EU imports of services representing €3.2 billion and exports €1.6 billion.\nFDI\nflows remained relatively steady between 2013 and 2021, resulting in a total EU FDI stock of €3.9 billion in Tunisia at the end of 2021. FDI flows to Tunisia are concentrated on developing the infrastructure network, and on the textiles and clothing sectors. EU companies are the biggest foreign investors in Tunisia, accounting for 80-85% of FDI entering the country, and the biggest employers, responsible for around 80% of the total employment generated by FDI.\nThe EU and Tunisia\nThe EU and Tunisia have concluded an\nAssociation Agreement\n, which was signed in July 1995 and entered into force on 30 March 1998. The Agreement established a free trade area under which all two-way trade in industrial products takes place free of any trade tariffs. Regarding agricultural, agri-food and fisheries products, the EU and Tunisia agreed to progressively open their respective markets for selected products. Alongside these reductions in trade tariffs, the Association Agreement also contains provisions under which the EU and Tunisia have agreed to:\nrules and disciplines on the use of non-tariff-based trade measures such as quotas and product standards;\na general right to establish businesses and provide services in the other party’s territory;\nallow for current payments and movement of capital, and;\nhave common rules on competition and intellectual property.\nIn 2009, the EU and Tunisia signed a bilateral protocol on the establishment of a\ndispute settlement mechanism\n, which entered into force in September 2011.\nNegotiations for a\nDeep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) between the EU and Tunisia\nwere launched in Tunis on 13 October 2015. The overall goal of the negotiations is to create new trade and investment opportunities and to better integrate Tunisia's economy into the EU single market. The DCFTA also aims to support ongoing economic reforms in Tunisia and to bring Tunisian legislation closer to that of the EU in trade-related areas.\nThe fourth full round of the EU-DCFTA negotiations took place in Tunis during the week of 29 April -3 May 2019. Discussions covered a wide range of issues including agriculture, services and sustainable development. The EU and Tunisia published a\njoint report\n, the EU-proposed\nnegotiation texts\nand\nexplanatory factsheets\nfollowing the round. Negotiations have been put on hold for the time being. See\nfull report\n.\nA\nSustainability Impact Assessment\n(SIA) of the DCFTA with Tunisia was carried out by an independent contractor in 2013.\nIn 2021, under the new\nEU Trade Policy Review\n, the EU has offered to discuss modernising trade and investment relations with Tunisia, to better adapt them to today’s challenges.\nFinancial support\nThe European Neighbourhood Policy provides a framework for political and financial assistance from the EU to Tunisia. For the period 2017-2020, under the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI), €900 million (€300 million per year) was committed to  bilateral assistance for Tunisia. This aimed to support the following three priority areas: (i) promoting good governance and the rule of law; (ii) investing in the future by stimulating sustainable economic growth and generating employment; and (iii) reinforcing social cohesion between generations and regions.\nUnder the EU Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2021-2027, a new broad financial cooperation instrument – the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) – was adopted as the basis to support EU-Tunisia cooperation.\nTunisia is one of the largest recipients of EU funds in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy. More information on EU support is available from the\nDirectorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations\n.\nTunisia in the Southern Neighbourhood\nThe EU established its privileged partnership with the Eastern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean back in 1995 with the launch of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership at the Barcelona Conference, aiming to establish an area of peace, stability and economic prosperity that upholds democratic values and human rights.\nThe 25\nth\nanniversary of the Barcelona Process in November 2020 was an opportunity to reflect on the strategic partnership with the region in light of the political, socioeconomic, financial and environmental challenges exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and to reassess the EU’s partnership with Tunisia and the other Southern Neighbourhood partner countries. Following consultations with partners, this reflection resulted in the Joint Communication by the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on ‘\nA renewed partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood - A new Agenda for the Mediterranean\n’ and the annexed ‘\nEconomic and Investment Plan for the Southern Neighbours\n’ in February 2021.\nMore information on the Southern Neighbourhood\nIn 2004, Tunisia signed the Agadir Agreement with Jordan, Egypt, and Morocco. This committed all parties to remove all tariffs on trade between them and to harmonise their legislation with regard to standards and customs procedures. The Agadir Agreement entered into force in July 2006, and an Agadir Technical Unit in Amman ensures its implementation. Lebanon and Palestine joined the Agreement in 2020.\nThe impact of trade component of the EU’s Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Tunisia was assessed in the\nEx-Post Evaluation\nof Trade Chapters of the Six Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements with the EU’s Southern Neighbours (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia), which was published by the European Commission in 2021.\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation and the PEM Convention\non rules of origin\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation system of origin was created in 2005. It brings together the EU, Tunisia, and other partners in Europe and the Mediterranean to support regional integration by creating a common system of rules of origin. Rules of origin are the technical criteria which determine whether a specific product qualifies for duty-free or other preferential access under a given trade agreement.\nCumulation of origin means a product coming from one partner country can be processed or added to a product of a second partner country and still be considered as an ‘originating product’ of that second partner country for the purposes of a particular trade agreement.\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean system allows for diagonal cumulation (i.e. cumulation between two or more countries) between the EU, EFTA countries, Turkey, the Western Balkans, the Faroe Islands, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and any country that signed the Barcelona Declaration of 1995. The system was originally based on a network of Free Trade Agreements with identical origin protocols.\nThese individual origin protocols are being progressively replaced by a reference to the\nRegional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin\n(PEM Convention), which was established in 2011 to provide a more unified framework for origin protocols. Tunisia acceded to the Regional Convention on 1 January 2015.\nMore information on Mediterranean preferential Rules of Origin\nCommittees and Dialogues\nThe EU and Tunisia meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the Agreement.\nTechnical committee meetings - agendas and reports\nTrading with Tunisia\nImporting into the EU\nfrom Tunisia\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom Tunisia\nExporting from the EU\nto Tunisia\nTrade defence measures in force in Tunisia\nTrade relations are part of\nthe EU's overall political and economic relations with Tunisia\nTunisia has been a\nmember of the World Trade Organization\nsince 29 March 1995\nShare this page",

Accession negotiations started in 2005, but have not advanced recently. Türkiye is a member of the Union for the Mediterranean.\nTrade picture\nThe EU-Türkiye Customs Union has enabled bilateral trade to increase significantly, reaching a record high of almost €206 billion in 2023.\nTürkiye became the EU’s 5\nth\nlargest trade partner in 2023, representing 4.1% of the EU’s total trade in goods with the world (compared to 3.3% in 2022).\nThe EU’s exports of goods to Türkiye totalled €111 billion in 2023. The EU’s imports of goods from Türkiye amounted to €95.5 billion. On both sides, exports of motor vehicles, machinery, and electrical equipment lead the way.\nThe EU stands as Türkiye’s largest goods import and export partner by a significant margin. In 2023, 41% of Türkiye’s exported goods were destined for the EU, while 29% of the country’s imported goods originated from the EU.\nTotal trade in services between the EU and Türkiye amounted to €35 billion in 2022, representing a significant increase from €24.2 billion in 2021. This accounted for 1.4% of the EU’s total trade with the world in services. Transport and travel services are the EU’s most imported services from Türkiye, and transport and ICT services are the EU’s most exported services to Türkiye.\n*\nServices data is only available with a delay of one year\n.\nThe EU and Türkiye\nIn 1963, the European Economic Community (the EU’s predecessor) and Türkiye signed an\nAssociation Agreement\n(the ‘Ankara Agreement’), in which both parties agreed to progressively establish a Customs Union over a period of several years. An Additional Protocol was signed in November 1970, setting out a timetable for the abolition of tariffs and quotas on industrial goods circulating between the parties. The final phase of the Customs Union was completed on 1 January 1996 with the implementation of the\nAssociation Council Decision No 1/95\n(the Customs Union Decision), which is currently in force.\nThe Customs Union Decision both confirmed the liberalised trade regime (the removal of tariffs and quantitative restrictions) for all industrial goods between the EU and Turkey, and established a requirement for Turkey's alignment with the EU's customs tariffs and rules, commercial policy, competition policy, intellectual property rights, and technical legislation related to the scope of the Customs Union.\nIn addition, the EU and Türkiye have concluded two further bilateral preferential trade agreements. The first agreement, the\nagreement\nbetween the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and Türkiye on trade in products covered by the Treaty establishing the ECSC, established a Free Trade Agreement for coal, iron and steel products in 1996, along with relevant competition rules. Further to the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, the EU took over this agreement. The second agreement,\nAssociation Council Decision No 1/98\n(amended by\nDecision No 2/2006\n), provides for preferential concessions on trade in certain agricultural and fishery products.\nIn December 2016, the Commission proposed to modernise the Customs Union and to extend bilateral trade relations to areas such as services, public procurement and sustainable development. The Commission proposal was based on comprehensive preparatory work throughout 2016, which included a public\nconsultation\nwith stakeholders and an\nimpact assessment\n. However, the Council has not yet adopted the negotiating directives.\nMore information on the Customs Union and preferential arrangements\nThe inaugural meeting of a new EU-Türkiye High-Level Dialogue on Trade took place on 8 July 2024 in Brussels.

It formally entered into force on 1 September 2017 following ratification by all EU Member States.\nThe DCFTA has provisionally applied since 1 January 2016.\nThe\nPriority Action Plan\n(PAP) (\nsee infographic\n) for enhanced implementation of the EU-Ukraine DCFTA in 2023-2024 lays down a set of concrete actions to accelerate and monitor the full implementation of the DCFTA, providing Ukraine with further access to the EU Single Market.\nTrade picture\nThe EU is Ukraine's largest trading partner, accounting for 56% of its trade in goods in 2023. Ukraine is the EU's 16\nth\nbiggest trading partner, accounting for 1.2% of the EU's total trade in goods last year. Total trade in goods between the EU and Ukraine reached €61.9 billion in 2023, meaning that trade in goods has more than doubled since the entry into force of the DCFTA in 2016.\nThe EU's imports from Ukraine amounted to €22.8 billion in 2023. Ukraine's main exports to the EU by value are cereals (21.9% of total exports), animal or vegetable fats and oils (9.2%), ores, slag and ash (8.3%), oil seeds (8.2%), and iron and steel (7.9%). In 2023, Ukraine remained the EU's\nthird-biggest source of EU agrifood imports\nby value.\nThe EU's exports to Ukraine amounted to €39.1 billion in 2023. The EU's main exports to Ukraine are mineral fuels and mineral oils (16.6% of all exports), motor vehicles (9.9%), machinery (9.1%), electrical machinery (8.9%),  and arms and ammunition (4.3%).\nThe EU and Ukraine\nThe AA/DCFTA aims to boost trade in goods and services between the EU and Ukraine by gradually cutting tariffs and bringing Ukraine's rules in line with those of the EU in certain industrial sectors and agricultural products.\nTo better integrate with the EU market, Ukraine is aligning its legislation to the EU's norms and standards for industrial and agri-food products. Ukraine is also approximating its legislation to the EU's in trade-related areas such as:\nCompetition;\nTechnical barriers to trade (TBT);\nSanitary and phytosanitary (SPS);\nCustoms and trade facilitation;\nProtection of intellectual property rights, and;\nPublic procurement.\nResponse to the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine\nIn response to the Russian Federation's illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol in 2014, the decision by the Russian Federation to recognise the non-government-controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts as independent entities in February 2022 (followed later by Kherson and Zaporizhzhia), and the Russian Federation's unprovoked and unjustified full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the EU has introduced a series of trade-related restrictive measures.\nSince 2014, the EU has banned the import of goods originating in Crimea and Sevastopol, as well as investments and a number of directly related services there. Similar restrictive measures were adopted in 2022 regarding the non government-controlled areas of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts of Ukraine. This sanctions regime consists of\nCouncil Decisions (CFSP) 2022/266\nand\nCouncil Regulation (EU) 2022/263\n. The measures therein are very similar to those concerning Crimea and Sevastopol.\nMore information\nTemporary measures in support of Ukrainian exports to the EU\nThe EU has granted Ukraine full trade liberalisation, suspending import duties, quotas and trade defence measures for imports from Ukraine on a temporary basis. This is known as the\nAutonomous Trade Measures (ATM) Regulation\n. These measures first entered into force on 4 June 2022 and were renewed for subsequent years on 6 June 2023 and 6 June 2024 respectively. The current measures will remain in force until 5 June 2025. Thanks to these measures, the EU is significantly supporting Ukraine's economy by helping alleviate the difficult situation faced by Ukrainian producers and exporters.\nMore information:\nMonitoring data on imports from Ukraine into the EU subject to trade liberalisation measures\nMore information:\nEU extends trade support to Ukraine for one more year\nThe Autonomous Trade Measures Regulation contains an emergency brake that is activated if imports of eggs, poultry, sugar, oats, maize, groats or honey exceed average imports between 1 July 2021 and 31 December 2024. The emergency brake has been activated for\noats\n,\neggs\n,\nsugar\n,\ngroats\nand\nhoney\n. An implementing regulation outlines the monitoring of this emergency brake. The development of imports for the products subject to the emergency brake can be followed in the tariff quota consultation database.\nThe regulation is just one of the measures adopted by the EU in solidarity with Ukraine.

        "description": "Country or region\nWestern Balkans\nTrade topics\nNegotiations and agreements\nTrade policy\nTrade plays an important role in the EU's efforts to promote peace, stability, freedom and economic prosperity in the Western Balkans.\nThe Western Balkans consists of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Kosovo*.\nTrade picture\nFor all of the Western Balkan partners, the EU is the leading trade partner, accounting for two-thirds (66.7%) of the region's total trade; while the region's share of overall EU trade is only 1.5%.\nAfter two years of substantial recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, 2023 saw a decline of 2.7% in trade between the EU and the Western Balkans, bringing the total value of the two sides' bilateral trade to €82 billion. This represents an increase of 135% in total bilateral trade with the Western Balkans since 2013. Overall, this trade expansion has been to the benefit of the EU's Western Balkan partners; as the region increased its exports to the EU by 160%, compared to an increase of EU exports to the region of 119%.\nIn 2023, the EU's main imports from the Western Balkans were: machinery and appliances (24%), mineral products (12%), base metals (11.6%), and chemicals (11.1%).\nThe EU's main exports to the Western Balkans were: machinery and appliances (20.4%), mineral products (12.4%), chemicals (10.1%), transport equipment (9.4%), and base metals (9.4%).\nThe EU and the Western Balkans\nAll countries of the Western Balkans have a European integration perspective, which was first recognised during the Feira European Council in 2000. This was further confirmed by the Thessaloniki European Council in 2003 and by the Sofia European Council in May 2018. This European perspective is integrated into the Stabilisation and Association Process, which is the EU's policy in relation to the countries of the Western Balkans. Under this process, all Western Balkan countries have a common future as EU Member States.\nSince the launch of the Stabilisation and Association Process, the EU has progressively concluded bilateral 'Stabilisation and Association Agreements' (SAAs) with each of the Western Balkan partners:\nAlbania\n(2009),\nNorth Macedonia\n(2004),\nMontenegro\n(2010),\nSerbia\n(2013),\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n(2015) and\nKosovo\n* (2016).\nThe SAAs are tools which provide for the economic development and political stabilisation of the countries in the region, and for the creation of a close, long-term association between the EU and the Western Balkans. In effect, the SAAs constitute the legal instrument for alignment to the EU\nacquis\nand progressive integration into the EU market.\nThe SAAs established a free-trade area for a transitional period, which has now ended for all. The Agreements foresee the elimination of duties and non-tariff restrictions on bilateral trade and cover goods in all Chapters of the Harmonised System. Only a few exceptions, concerning some agricultural and fishery products, are not fully liberalised, and are subject to reduced duties and/or preferential quantitative concessions.\nIn addition, the agreements include provisions concerning competition matters, a high level of protection of intellectual property rights, and strengthened co-operation in customs matters. They also include additional disciplines concerning, notably, government procurement, legislative approximation in many areas including standardisation, and provisions regarding services and establishment.\nOn 8 November 2023, the European Commission adopted its\nNew Growth Plan for the Western Balkans\n, which aims to bring the Western Balkans closer to the EU by offering them some of the benefits of EU membership in advance of accession, boosting economic growth and accelerating socio-economic convergence.  A noteworthy example of planned actions regarding the free movement of goods includes the possible conclusion of agreements on conformity assessment (ACAAs) to unlock the single market for goods manufactured in the Western Balkans, based on full alignment with the relevant horizontal EU product\nacquis\n.\nFor more information, see also: Commission Communication on '\nWestern Balkans: Enhancing the European perspective\n', and the\n2019 Communication on EU Enlargement Policy\n.\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation and the PEM Convention on rules of origin\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation system of origin was created in 2005. It brings together the EU, the Western Balkans, and other partners in Europe and the Mediterranean to support regional integration by creating a common system of rules of origin. Rules of origin are technical criteria which determine whether a specific product qualifies for duty-free or other preferential access under a given trade agreement.\nCumulation of origin means a product coming from one partner country can be processed or added to a product of a second partner country and still be considered an ‘originating product’ of that second partner country for the purposes of a particular trade agreement.\nThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean system allows for diagonal cumulation (i.e. cumulation between two or more countries) between the EU, EFTA countries, Turkey, the Western Balkans, the Faroe Islands, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and any country that signed the Barcelona Declaration of 1995. The system was originally based on a network of Free Trade Agreements with identical origin protocols.\nThese individual origin protocols have been progressively replaced by a reference to the\nRegional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin\n(PEM Convention), which was established in 2011 to provide a more unified framework for origin protocols. On 1 January 2025, the revised rules of the PEM Convention entered into force, and the Western Balkans have applied them since then.\nNew rules adopted for the Western Balkans:\nAs of 1 September 2021, the new rules became applicable between the EU and Albania (\nOJ L 2023/2676, 11.12.2023\n).\nAs of 9 September 2021, the new rules became applicable between the EU and North Macedonia (\nOJ L406, 16.11.2021, p.1\n).\nAs of 6 December 2021, the new rules became applicable between the EU and Serbia (\nOJ L163, 29.06.2023, p.12\n).\nAs of 2 February 2022, the new rules became applicable between the EU and Montenegro (\nOJ L156, 09.06.2022, p. 72\n).\nThe Decision 1/2022 of the EU-Kosovo* Stabilisation and Association Council regarding the implementation of the transitional rules entered into force on 29 April 2022 and shall apply as from\n15 October 2022\n(\nOJ L252, 30.09.2022, p. 87\n).\nAs of 11 December 2023, the\nnew rules became applicable\nbetween the EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nFor more information:\nCommission notice concerning the application of the transitional rules of origin providing for diagonal cumulation between the applying Contracting Parties in the pan-Euro-Mediterranean (PEM) zone\nAccessing the EU market\nSince 2000, the EU has been granting\nautonomous trade preferences\nto all the EU's Western Balkan partners.\nThese preferences, which were renewed for another five years at the end of 2020, allow nearly all exports to enter the EU without customs duties or limits on quantities.\nCommittees and Dialogues\nThe EU and the Western Balkans meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the agreement.\nMeetings and documents\nTrading with the Western Balkans\nImporting into the EU\nfrom the Western Balkans\nEU trade defence measures on imports\nfrom the Western Balkans\nExporting from the EU\nto the Western Balkans\nTrade defence measures in force in the Western Balkans\nTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo*.\nThe EU strongly supports the membership of the Western Balkans states in the World Trade Organization (WTO): Albania (2000), North Macedonia (2003) and Montenegro (2011) are already WTO members. The WTO accession negotiations with Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina are still ongoing.\nThe Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) is a single Free Trade Agreement (FTA) linking all the Western Balkans and Moldova.\n*\nThis designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and in line with UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence\n.\nLatest news\nNews article\n21 December 2020\nEU extends trade preferences for the Western Balkans for 5 more years\nThe European Union has extended its existing trade preferences to the Western Balkans for another five years until 31 December 2025.\n1 min read\nAll the latest news on EU trade\nShare this page",

        "description": "Trade topics\nSupport for developing countries\nTrade policy\nAt the 10\nth\nWTO Ministerial Conference in December 2015, WTO members agreed on a number of significant issues within the Doha Development Agenda and outlined the way forward in WTO negotiations.\nThe\nNairobi ministerial declaration\nfor the first time opened a new window of opportunity for WTO Members to explore new approaches to advance on ongoing negotiations and possibly consider expanding the scope of WTO rules to cover new issues.\nThe EU, together with other WTO Members, will work in the coming months to make sure that the WTO reaffirms its role as the centre of international trade policy and delivers on the issues that are most urgent for traders worldwide.\nThe Doha Development Round in a nutshell\nThe Doha Round of world trade negotiations, also known as\nthe Doha Development Agenda\n, was launched in Doha, Qatar in November 2001. The talks aimed at further liberalising trade, whilst making it easier for developing countries, particularly Least Developed Countries (LDCs), to integrate into the WTO multilateral system.\nThe main issues at stake are:\nReforming agricultural subsidies;\nEnsuring that new liberalisation in the global economy respects the need for sustainable economic growth in developing countries, and;\nImproving developing countries' access to global markets for their exports.\nDespite the EU's efforts, negotiations have stalled largely due to the lack of readiness from certain WTO Members to reform their agricultural policies.\nResults of the 10\nth\nWTO Ministerial Conference\nThe 10\nth\nWTO Ministerial Conference took place in December 2015 in Nairobi, Kenya. It was the first WTO Ministerial Conference ever held in Africa.\nThe EU, together with several other countries, put forward a joint compromise proposal to address the question of export competition in agriculture. The proposal constituted an important basis for the final deal, which includes the elimination of export subsidies, and the introduction of new rules for similar measures that also significantly distort international trade and disrupt local markets.\nIn Nairobi, WTO members also agreed on a set of important decisions addressing some demands of the least-developed countries, including:\nseeking to simplify the conditions that exporters from the poorest countries have to meet, so that their products benefit from trade agreements (so-called rules of origin);\ngiving more opportunities for businesses from the poorest countries to provide services in the WTO's 164 member countries, and;\nfacilitating the integration of least-developed countries' cotton producers in global trade.\nWTO members also agreed to continue negotiations on a longstanding proposal to shield trade-distorting\npublic stockholding programmes\nfor food security in developing countries from legal challenge. They also agreed on a proposal to allow developing countries to temporarily raise their tariffs to deal with import surges or price falls (the so-called 'special safeguard mechanism').\nFinally, ministers signed an important\ndeclaration\n. The Doha Development Agenda was not reconfirmed as such due to differences among WTO members regarding the value of the previously made attempts to reach consensus. While WTO members expressed their strong interest to advance negotiations on remaining Doha issues, some of them also supported the adoption of new approaches to advance on these issues. The declaration also recognises that some members wish to open negotiations on new issues in the WTO.\nResults of the 9\nth\nWTO Ministerial Conference\nThe main outcome of the 9\nth\nWTO Ministerial Conference was the Trade Facilitation Agreement.  The agreement aims to make it easier and cheaper to import and export by improving customs procedures and making rules more transparent.  Reducing global trade costs by 1% would increase worldwide income by more than USD 40 billion, 65% of which would go to developing countries. The gains from the Trade Facilitation Agreement are expected to be distributed among all countries and regions, with developing landlocked countries benefitting the most.\nThe Trade Facilitation Agreement will enter into force upon its ratification by 2/3 of WTO Members. The EU ratified the agreement in October 2015.\nIn Bali, WTO members also agreed on a series of Doha agriculture and development issues.\nMore on the Doha Development Agenda\nWTO website\nFactsheet: How the EU works with the WTO\nTune in to trade policy insights\n19 December 2024\nEpisode 10\nTom Moylan meets the new Trade and Economic Security Commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, to discuss Mercosur, tariffs, and trust.\n19/12/2024 | Episode 10 | 29 minutes\n14 November 2024\nEpisode 9\nDo you care about where our goods come from?

        "description": "Trade topics\nEU companies accessing world markets\nImporting into the EU\nTrade policy\nThe EU has achieved a strong position by acting together with one voice on the global stage, rather than with separate trade strategies.\nEurope has become deeply integrated into global markets. Thanks to the ease of modern transport and communications, it is now easier to produce, buy and sell goods around the world, which gives European companies of every size the potential to trade outside Europe.\nWorkers often deliver their services across different countries within a multinational or by specific service contracts.\nAs investors thrive in a stable, sound and predictable environment, they are looking for investment barriers to be dismantled and investments to be protected.\nEvery day, Europe exports hundreds of millions of euros worth of goods, and imports hundreds of millions more.\nEurope is the world's largest exporter of manufactured goods and services, and is itself the biggest export market for around 80 countries.\nTogether, the European Union's members account for 16% of world imports and exports (2022 data).\nWhy does it matter?\nThe development of trade – if properly managed – is an opportunity for economic growth. So EU trade policy seeks to create growth and jobs by increasing the opportunities for trade and investment with the rest of the world.\nBy working together, Europe has the weight to shape an open global trading system based on fair rules – and to ensure that those rules are respected.\nThe EU’s success is inextricably bound up with the success of our trading partners, both in the developed and developing world. For this reason, sustainable development is central to trade policy.\nThe EU is an attractive market to do business with\nWe have 440 million consumers looking for quality goods.\nWe are the world's largest single market, with transparent rules and regulations.\nWe have a secure legal investment framework that is among the most open in the world.\nWe are the most open market to developing countries in the world.\nFacts and figures on the EU’s position in global markets\nThe EU is the largest economy in the world. Although growth is projected to be slow, the EU remains the largest economy in the world with a GDP per head of €25,000 for its 440 million consumers.\nThe EU is the world's largest trading bloc. The EU is the world’s largest trader of manufactured goods and services.\nThe EU ranks first in both inbound and outbound international investments.\nThe EU is the top trading partner for 80 countries. By comparison, the US is the top trading partner for a little over 20 countries.\nThe EU is the most open to developing countries. Fuels excluded, the EU imports more from developing countries than the USA, Canada, Japan and China put together.\nThe EU benefits from being one of the most open economies in the world and remains committed to free trade.\nThe average applied tariff for goods imported into the EU is very low. More than 70% of imports enter the EU at zero or reduced tariffs.\nThe EU’s services markets are highly open and we have arguably the most open investment regime in the world.\nThe EU has not reacted to the crisis by closing markets. However, some of the EU’s trading partners have not been so restrained, as the EU has highlighted in the\nTrade and Investment Barriers Report\n.\nIn fact the EU has retained its capacity to conclude and implement trade agreements. Free trade agreements with\nSouth Korea\nand with\nSingapore\nare examples of this and the EU has an\nambitious agenda of trade agreements\nin the pipeline.\nMore on EU position in world trade\nEU trade agreements deliver on growth and jobs, support sustainable development\n.\nEurope 2020 – Europe's growth strategy\nWho does trade benefit and how?\n10 benefits for trade\nTune in to trade policy insights\n19 December 2024\nEpisode 10\nTom Moylan meets the new Trade and Economic Security Commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, to discuss Mercosur, tariffs, and trust.\n19/12/2024 | Episode 10 | 29 minutes\n14 November 2024\nEpisode 9\nDo you care about where our goods come from?

        "description": "Trade topics\nTrade policy\nWhat is trade policy?\nThe European Union manages its trade and investment relations with non-EU countries through its trade and investment policy.\nTrade outside the EU is an exclusive responsibility of the EU, rather than the national governments of member countries. This means the EU institutions make laws on trade matters, and negotiate and conclude international trade agreements.\nThe EU's responsibilities cover:\ntrade in\ngoods and services\n;\nthe commercial aspects of\nintellectual property\n, such as patents;\npublic procurement\n, and;\nforeign direct investment\n.\nArticle 207 of the\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union\nsets out the rules on EU trade policy.\nAn open, sustainable and assertive EU trade strategy\nOn 18 February 2021, the European Commission\nset out its new trade strategy for the coming years\n.\nReflecting the concept of ‘Open Strategic Autonomy’, it builds on the EU’s openness to contribute to the economic recovery by supporting the green and digital transformations.\nThe strategy includes a renewed focus on strengthening multilateralism and reforming global trade rules to ensure that they are fair and sustainable.\nWhere necessary, the EU will take a more assertive stance in defending its interests and values, including through new tools.\nWhy the EU negotiates trade deals\nBy acting together as one, EU countries benefit from increased negotiating power when making trade deals with other countries.\nThe EU negotiates trade agreements to strengthen our economy and create jobs.\nEU trade agreements help to do that in two ways. Trade agreements let European businesses:\naccess more easily and at lower prices the raw materials and other inputs they need, helping them to stay competitive, and;\ncompete more effectively abroad and export more to countries and regions outside the EU.\nThis increase in trade leads to growth in the economy and helps create jobs. It also gives consumers a wider choice of products at lower prices.\nIn addition, projecting EU\nrules and values\nin trade agreements helps the EU shape globalisation, especially on issues like human rights, working conditions and environmental protection.\nHow the EU negotiates trade deals\nFirst, the European Commission requests authorisation from the Council of the EU ('the Council') to negotiate a trade agreement with a trade partner. The Council's authorisation can include 'directives'. These are often referred to as the 'mandate' and set out what the Commission should achieve in the agreement.\nThen the Commission negotiates with the trading partner on behalf of the EU. During the negotiations, the Commission:\nworks closely with the\nCouncil's trade policy committee\n;\nkeeps the European Parliament fully informed;\nholds meetings with representatives of civil society, and;\npublishes:\nEU position papers;\nproposed texts for the agreement;\nreports of negotiations;\nimpact assessments;\nbackground papers, and;\nfactsheets.\nNegotiations might include:\nremoving or cutting customs duties (taxes) on goods that European companies export;\nscrapping any limits (quotas) on the amounts the partner country allows EU firms to export to it;\nallowing EU businesses to provide services and bid for public contracts in the partner country, and;\ncutting bureaucracy to make it easier for EU firms to export, but maintaining things like health and safety standards or environmental protection.\nOnce the Commission completes the negotiations, it publishes the agreement and presents the deal to the Council and the European Parliament.\nThe Council and the European Parliament examine the final deal and decide whether or not to approve it.\nIf they both approve it, the EU can conclude the agreement.\nIf the trade agreement covers areas where EU countries have responsibility, it can only be fully concluded after EU countries also ratify and sign the agreement.\nPutting EU trade policy into effect\nThe European Commission helps put EU trade policy into effect. This sometimes involves updating the EU's existing trade laws.\nTwo of the ways it does so are\ndelegated acts and implementing acts\n.\nBetween signing and ratifying the deal, parts of the agreement can be 'provisionally applied' – put into effect before ratification – if the Council decides to do so.\nProvisional application usually only takes effect once the European Parliament has given its consent.\nMore information on bilateral deals\nDocuments\nTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union\n(TFEU)\nCommon commercial policy\nHow agreements are negotiated\nThe legal acts of the Union: Delegated acts\nThe legal acts of the Union: Implementing acts\nProcedures for the adoption of acts and other provisions\nWhat did the Lisbon Treaty change?\nTransparency in EU trade negotiations\nAnnual activity report\nAnnual activity report 2023: Trade\nFinancing Decisions\nDG Trade Financing Decision 2025\nand\nAnnex\nDG Trade Financing Decision 2024\nand\nAnnex\nDG Trade Financing Decision 2023\nand\nAnnex\nDG Trade Financing Decision 2022\nand\nAnnex\nDG Trade Financing Decision 2021\nand\nAnnex\nDG Trade Financing Decision 2020\nand\nAnnex\nEU trade meetings with Civil Society\nContribute to a transparent and accountable EU trade policy by joining consultations with European civil society.\nView all EU trade meetings with civil society\nTune in to trade policy insights\n19 December 2024\nEpisode 10\nTom Moylan meets the new Trade and Economic Security Commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, to discuss Mercosur, tariffs, and trust.\n19/12/2024 | Episode 10 | 29 minutes\n14 November 2024\nEpisode 9\nDo you care about where our goods come from?

To become a member of an EU DAG, an EU organisation must:\nBe an independent and not-for-profit civil society organisation;\nRepresent or promote EU interests;\nHave specific expertise or competence on areas covered by the mandate of the DAG, and;\nBe registered in both the Transparency Register of the European Commission/European Parliament/Council of the EU and in the Civil Society Dialogue database of DG Trade.\nSome members are designated by the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC).\nCivil society meetings and involvement in trade agreements\nDAG members meet several times a year to discuss issues under their mandate in the framework of a trade agreement. They advise the EU and its trade partners, who discuss the issues raised at their annual meeting. Once per year, a joint civil society meeting is organised under each trade agreement. This meeting is generally open to all civil society organisations beyond DAG members. The DAGs from the EU and from the partner country or countries also meet in a back-to-back session alongside the joint meeting.\nTrade and Sustainable Development (TSD) Review\nIn DG Trade’s\nTSD Review of June 2022\n, the Commission outlined several measures to ensure more participation and support for civil society:\nMake it easier for civil society and DAGs to lodge complaints on violations of sustainability commitments in trade agreements\nIntroduce timelines for the Commission to follow as a general rule when dealing with TSD complaints, by updating the\nOperating Guidelines\nfor the\nSingle Entry Point\non trade agreements;\nBetter involve DAGs in technical assistance projects and in meetings with EU Member States;\nEnsure more transparency regarding the work of the DAGs, including publishing the lists of participating organisations, and promoting interaction between DAGs, and;\nFurther strengthen the role of EU DAGs by providing resources for their functioning.\nFurther information on involving civil society organisations\nAny EU civil society organisation can file a complaint on sustainability issues in EU trade agreements. Consultation with civil society begins long before an agreement enters into force. The EU engages with civil society before negotiations for an agreement have even begun. The Commission keeps receiving input throughout the process via Civil Society Dialogue meetings and regular contact with stakeholders. It also publishes negotiation round reports and other relevant documents.\nThe Commission conducts\nSustainability Impact Assessments (SIAs)\n, which are in-depth analyses of the potential economic, social, human rights and environmental impacts of ongoing trade negotiations, as well as\nex-post evaluations\nto assess whether trade agreements are working as expected in achieving their objectives and why. These assessments are an opportunity for stakeholders in both the EU and in the partner countries to share their views with the Commission.\nFind below the list of EU DAGs information on joint meetings between DAG members from both parties, and on Trade and Sustainable Development Committees between the EU and partner countries.\nInformation about DAGs can be found on the website of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC)\nCANADA\nText of the Agreement\n(Article 24.13)\nReports of meetings / work plans / joint statements:\nCivil Society Forum\nTrade and Sustainable Development Committee\nMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory Group\nCARIFORUM\nEU Domestic Advisory Group members\nText of the Agreement\n(Article 232)\nReports of meetings / work plans / joint statements\nMore information on the EU Domestic advisory group\nCENTRAL AMERICA\nText of the Agreement\n(Article 10)\nReports of meetings / work plans / joint statements\nMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory Group\nCOLOMBIA/ECUADOR/PERU – ANDEAN COMMUNITY\nText of the Agreement\n(Article 282)\nReports of meetings / work plans / joint statements\nMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory Group\nGEORGIA\nText of the Agreement\n(Articles 240 and 241)\nReports of meetings / work plans / joint statements\nMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory Group\nJAPAN\nText of the Agreement\n(Article 16.15)\nReports of meetings / work plans / joint statements:\nCivil Dociety Forum\nTrade and Sustainable Development Committee\nMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory Group\nMOLDOVA\nText of the Agreement\n(Articles 376 and 377)\nReports of meetings / work plans / joint statements\nMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory Group\nREPUBLIC OF KOREA\nText of the Agreement\n(Articles 13.12 and 13.13)\nReports of meetings / work plans / joint statements:\nCivil Society Forum\nTrade and Sustainable Development Committee\nInformation on the EU-Republic of Korea TSD dispute settlement case\nMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory Group\nSINGAPORE\nText of the Agreement\n(Article 12.15)\nReports of meetings / work plans / joint statements:\nCivil Society Forum\nTrade and Sustainable Development Committee\nMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory Group\nUKRAINE\nText of the Agreement\n(Article 299)\nRules of Procedure of the Trade and Sustainable Development Committee\nReports of meetings / work plans / joint statements:\nCivil Society Forum\nTrade and Sustainable Development Committee\nMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory Group\nUNITED KINGDOM\nText of the Agreement\n(Articles 12, 13 and 14)\nReports of meetings / work plans / joint statements:\nCivil Society Forum\nCommittee on Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition and Sustainable Development\nMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory Group\nVIETNAM\nText of the Agreement\n(Article 13.14)\nReports of meetings / work plans / joint statements:\nCivil Society Forum\nTrade and Sustainable Development Committee\nMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory Group\nMore information\n2023 call for the renewal of Domestic Advisory Groups\nTune in to trade policy insights\n19 December 2024\nEpisode 10\nTom Moylan meets the new Trade and Economic Security Commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, to discuss Mercosur, tariffs, and trust.\n19/12/2024 | Episode 10 | 29 minutes\n14 November 2024\nEpisode 9\nDo you care about where our goods come from?

        "description": "Country or region\nAfrican, Caribbean, Pacific (ACP)\nTrade topics\nEconomic Partnerships\nThe Samoa Agreement\nThe EU’s relationship with the Member States of the Organisation for African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS) is governed by the\nOACPS-EU Partnership Agreement\n, also known as the\nSamoa Agreement\n. It was signed in Apia, Samoa on 15 November 2023 and entered into provisional application on 1 January 2024. The modernised partnership provides a new legal framework for the EU’s relations with OACPS members for the next 20 years. The agreement comprises a common foundation and three regional protocols (for Africa, for the Caribbean, and for the Pacific).\nThe Samoa Agreement is the successor of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, concluded in 2000. The Cotonou agreement offered EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries the opportunity to negotiate development-oriented free trade arrangements called Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). EPAs are stand-alone international agreements that remain anchored to the essential and fundamental elements of the Samoa Agreement, as was the case for the Cotonou Partnership Agreement.\nEconomic Partnership Agreements in a nutshell\nThe EU is the biggest trading partner of the ACP group of countries, with 19% of their total trade flows.\nEight Economic Partnership Agreements are in application\nwith 33 out of 79 ACP countries. These include 14 Caribbean countries, 15 African countries and four Pacific countries. Other ACP countries benefit from privileged access to the EU via the EU’s\nGeneralised Scheme of Preferences\n(GSP), mostly using the\nEverything But Arms\n(EBA) scheme.\nEPAs are WTO-compatible agreements. They go beyond conventional free-trade agreements to focus on ACP countries’ development, taking account of their socio-economic circumstances. They include co-operation and assistance (for example, in areas such as sanitary norms and standards) to help EPA countries benefit from the agreements.\nEPAs are tailor-made to suit specific regional circumstances.\nEPAs open the EU’s markets to EPA countries immediately.\nEPAs create joint institutions that monitor the implementation of the agreements and address trade issues in a cooperative way.\nEPAs are drivers of change that contribute to reform and good economic governance.\nTop 10 benefits of EPAs for partner countries\nEPAs: leveraging trade and investment for sustainable development\nThe overall objective of EPAs is to leverage trade and investment for sustainable development, and hence contribute to eradicating poverty.\nEPAs include the following features that go beyond access to EU markets:\nEPAs are permanent partnerships that encourage a progressive shift from aid to trade and investment as engines of growth, jobs and poverty reduction. They entail rights and obligations for both EU and ACP countries.\nEPAs offer zero tariffs and unlimited quantities (duty and quota-free) for all products (except for arms).\nEPAs also have\nflexible conditions\n(rules of origin) under which exporters in EPA countries can more easily source from elsewhere the inputs they need to make their final products without losing their free access to the EU.\nEPA partners do not pay tariffs or duties on their exports to the EU, while they open their markets only partially to the EU (on average 80%), with long transition periods for doing so. Safeguard measures can be activated if surges in imports of EU products disturb local markets.\nEPAs support ACP countries' efforts to develop new industries and diversify their economies by shifting their reliance on commodities to higher-value products and services.\nEPAs contribute to a stable and conducive investment climate by providing certainty on trade rules governing exports and imports from the EU. This helps to attract foreign investors to establish production in a given country.\nEPAs aim to contribute to regional economic integration by linking smaller markets in larger EPA regions that were established by the ACP countries themselves.\nEU trade policy and development cooperation mutually reinforce one another. Through its Aid for Trade initiative, the EU supports partner countries in preparing and implementing regional and bilateral trade. Aid for Trade strengthens ACP countries’ trade policy capacity, and enhances private sector development via access to finance, skills, services, infrastructure and other inputs that help SMEs to become competitive in global markets.\nThe focus is currently on implementing the EPAs and extending their scope.\nOnce an EPA has been signed and ratified and applies, the focus of the process moves to implementation. This means\nputting the partnership into practice\n, to enable the private sector and consumers alike to reap the benefits of these agreements. EPAs are already delivering business benefits in the countries concerned, ranging from textiles from Madagascar, grapes from Namibia and processed fish from Papua New Guinea to medical instruments from Mauritius.\nRead more on each EPA’s status of implementation in the EU’s annual\nFTA Implementation and Enforcement Report\n. The accompanying\nStaff Working Document\nfeatures sections on the EU-Southern African Development Community (SADC) EPA, the EU-Cote d’Ivoire EPA, the EU-Ghana EPA, the EU-Cameroon EPA, the EU-Cariforum EPA, and the EU-Pacific EPA).\nThe scope of EPAs can be extended by:\nSupporting accession to EPAs by interested parties. For example, Samoa joined the EU-Pacific EPA in 2018; the Solomon Islands joined in 2020; Niue, Tonga and Tuvalu will start applying the agreement after they have notified the EU that they have completed their internal adoption procedures; and accession processes are underway with the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Timor-Leste, and Vanuatu. Comoros joined the EU-Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) EPA in 2019. Angola has requested accession to the EU-SADC EPA.\nAdding more trade-related topics to EPAs – for example, trade in services, investment, trade and sustainable development – to modernise them, such as during\nongoing negotiations\nto modernise the EPA with five Eastern and Southern African (ESA-5) countries.\nEPAs in Africa: Towards a continental vision\nIn Africa, EPAs are key tools of the EU’s\nComprehensive Strategy with Africa\n. The economic pillar of this strategy identifies trade – alongside regional and continental economic integration – as major elements to promote the sustainable development of African countries. The 2021\nTrade Policy Review Communication\nconfirmed that Africa is of\nparticular importance\nto the EU’s trade policy.\nFactsheet on EU-Africa trade and investment relations\nMeetings and documents on the relationship between the EPAs and the ACTFA\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, there are currently 15 countries implementing an EPA. Most other countries benefit from preferential unilateral schemes.\nInfographic on the EU-Africa trade partnership\nEPAs with Sub-Saharan African countries and other EU free trade agreements with Northern African countries contribute to the\nAfrican Continental Free Trade Area\n(AfCFTA). EPAs already contain useful trade tools for building the AfCFTA.

The Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) was born. Today, about a dozen countries have GSP mechanisms in place.\nGeneralised Scheme of Preferences in a nutshell\nThe European Union’s GSP\nis widely recognised as the most progressive in terms of coverage and benefits.\nThe EU's GSP comprises three arrangements:\nStandard GSP\nfor low and lower-middle income countries.

GSP+ slashes these same tariffs to 0% for vulnerable low- and lower-middle income countries that implement 27 international conventions related to labour and human rights, environmental and climate protection, and good governance.\nEBA (Everything But Arms)\n: the special arrangement for\nleast developed countries\n(LDCs), providing them with duty-free, quota-free access to the EU market for all products except arms and ammunition.\nFind the arrangement that benefits your country\nList of GSP beneficiary countries\nGSP statistics:\ndetails regarding benefits per regime, country and product\nVisit the\nAccess to Markets portal\nto find the scheme that benefits your country.\nConditions\nDeveloping countries are automatically granted GSP if they:\nAre classified as having an income level below 'upper middle income' by the World Bank\n.\nDo not benefit from another arrangement (like a Free Trade Agreement) granting them preferential access to the EU market.\nAre on the list of eligible countries\n.\nIn addition, if a country applies for GSP+ status, the beneficiary country is required to ratify 27 international conventions, and to cooperate with the European Commission to monitor the implementation of these conventions related to environmental and climate protection, and good governance\nlisted in the GSP Regulation\n.\nLDCs are automatically granted the benefits of the ‘Everything But Arms’ arrangement, even if they have another arrangement in place.\nAll GSP beneficiary countries have to respect the principles of fifteen core conventions on human rights and labour rights\nlisted in the GSP Regulation\n.\nMonitoring\nThe EU continuously monitors GSP+ beneficiary countries’ effective implementation of the 27 international conventions on human rights, labour rights, environmental and climate protection, and good governance. This monitoring includes exchanges of information, dialogue and visits, and it involves various stakeholders, including civil society.\nThe Commission publishes a report on the implementation of GSP every two years, providing information on the progress made by the GSP+ beneficiary countries in implementing the 27 international conventions.\nReport for 2020-2022\nand its country annexes:\nArmenia\nBangladesh, Cambodia and Myanmar\nBolivia\nCabo Verde\nKyrgyz Republic\nPakistan\nMongolia\nPhilippines\nSri Lanka\nUzbekistan\nKey facts on the report\nEnhanced engagement with other GSP beneficiaries\nAs announced in\nTrade for All\n, the EU has stepped up its engagement with three GSP beneficiary countries: Bangladesh, Cambodia and Myanmar.\nThe EU is engaging with these countries due to the gravity of alleged shortcomings in respecting core human rights and labour rights standards, as testified by reports from the United Nations, the International Labour Organization, and civil society.\nGSP preferences can be removed if beneficiary countries fail to respect core human rights and labour rights. On 12 February 2020, the Commission decided to withdraw part of the tariff preferences granted to Cambodia under the European Union’s Everything But Arms (EBA) trade arrangement due to serious and systematic violations of the human rights principles enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. See\nLegal Act\nand\nMemo\n.\nAs part of the biennial report, a\nspecific report\nwas published on the Enhanced Engagement, which provides details on issues discussed and priorities for further monitoring with the countries concerned.\nImpact of GSP\nA\n2018 GSP mid-term evaluation\nshows that the EU’s GSP is delivering on its main objectives of contributing to poverty eradication and sustainable development in GSP beneficiary countries.\nThe evaluation indicates that countries increasingly use the available trade preferences and diversify their exports. Moreover, GSP+ beneficiaries saw an economic incentive for making progress in ratifying and implementing the 27 international conventions required under GSP+.\nBetween 2014 and 2019, the 27 EU Member States' imports from current GSP beneficiaries utilising any of the existing arrangements increased by 25%, whereas overall imports from third countries increased by 16% over the same period. Imports under EBA even outperformed this, increasing by 47% (from 17.1 billion EUR in 2014 to 25.2 billion EUR in 2019). Imports from LDCs accounted for 2% of the EU’s total imports in 2019; 67% of these imports from LDCs benefitted from EBA preferences.\nGSP Review\nOn 22 September 2021, the Commission adopted a\nlegislative proposal\nfor the EU’s Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) for the period 2024-2034.\nThe current GSP Regulation is set to expire by the end of 2023. The Commission is proposing to continue the scheme while improving some of its key features. The aim is to respond to the evolving needs and challenges of GSP countries, and to strengthen the scheme’s social, environmental and climate aspects.\nThe review is based on the 2018 Mid-Term Evaluation (MTE) of GSP, the External Study supporting the Impact Assessment, a\nCommission Impact Assessment\n, and the 2020\nOpen Public Consultation\nthat confirmed the achievements of the EU GSP.\nExtension of the current GSP Regulation\nIn November 2023, the Council of EU Member States and the European Parliament signed an amendment to the existing Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) Regulation, in order to extend the GSP scheme  for the period 2024-2027.\nAs the current scheme is set to expire at the end of 2023, this extension will provide legal certainty to beneficiary countries, and to businesses and operators present in these countries and in the EU. The extension of the current scheme will shortly be published in the EU’s Official Journal, and will take effect the day after its publication.\nThis will allow GSP beneficiaries to continue enjoying tariff preferences, as the Council and the Parliament have not yet reached an agreement on the Commission's proposal of September 2021 to update the GSP rules. The proposal to extend the current GSP scheme was put forward by the Commission in July 2023.\nInvolving stakeholders\nEuropean Parliament and Council of the European Union\nThe Commission regularly reports to the European Parliament, and to the Council of the European Union, on GSP matters. The Commission also regularly answers questions from Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). These questions (and responses) and related issues can be found on the\nEuropean Parliament's website\n.\nThe\nCouncil\nis overseeing the GSP through the\nWorking Party on the Generalised System of Preferences\n.\nIn addition, the Commission chairs the\nExpert Group on the Generalised Scheme of Preferences\nand the Generalised Preferences Committee, which gathers expert representatives from each Member State to oversee and vote on issues related to the GSP.\nIndustry\nThe GSP Regulation has several ways to ensure that the interests of European industries are safeguarded:\nGSP beneficiaries that become 'upper middle-income' countries are removed from the GSP.\nGSP beneficiaries can lose preferences for specific product categories that are deemed to have become sufficiently competitive:\nsuspended tariff preferences for 2020-2022\n.\nSafeguard measures can be requested by EU industry based on evidence that imports from a GSP beneficiary have caused serious economic difficulties for that industry:\nsafeguard measures on rice from Cambodia and Myanmar\n.\nContact\nFor any further questions regarding the GSP, please contact\nTRADE-GSP\nec\n[dot]\neuropa\n[dot]\neu\n(TRADE-GSP[at]ec[dot]europa[dot]eu)\nMore on the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP)\nEU GSP Regulation\n(2012)\nAll implementing acts\nof the GSP Regulation\nAll delegated acts\nof the GSP Regulation\nCommission proposal for a GSP Regulation post-2023\nMid-term Evaluation\n(October 2018)\nLegislative Train Schedule for the review of the GSP Regulation\nPublic Consultation on the GSP\n(now closed)\nStudy in support of an impact assessment of the post-2023 EU GSP Regulation\nCommission impact assessment on the proposal for a GSP Regulation post-2023\nGSP Hub\nGSP+ factsheet\n, May 2019\nGSP Handbook/Insights\n, September 2021\nPersonal data protection: the EU institutions and bodies process personal data in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.

The expert group is comprised by representatives from relevant national authorities and from the European Commission.\nReports from the Commission Expert Group on Trade and Sustainable Development meetings\nIf Member States or EU civil society representatives consider that TSD commitments in trade agreements are being infringed, they may lodge a TSD complaint with the\nSingle Entry Point\n. The Commission services will examine the allegations and consider the most appropriate course of action in that respect. They will remain in close contact with the complainant throughout the process. In 2022, the Commission presented updated\noperating guidelines\nfor the Single Entry Point, making it easier for civil society to lodge complaints regarding violations of sustainability commitments, with corresponding timelines that the Commission follows as a general rule when treating TSD complaints.\nDomestic advisory groups (DAGs) in the EU and partner countries bring together environmental, labour, and business organisations to discuss and advise on the implementation of parts of or the entirety of EU trade agreements. The External Relations Section within the European Economic and Social Committee acts as secretariat of EU DAGs.\nMore information on domestic advisory groups and related meetings\nTrade and Sustainable Development review 2022\nOn 22 June 2022, the Commission adopted its '\nCommunication on the power of trade partnerships: together for green and just economic growth\n'. This was the result of the Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) review of the 15-point action plan for improving the implementation and enforcement of TSD chapters in trade agreements, announced in the\nTrade Policy Review communication of 2021\n.\nThe Communication identifies how to enhance the contribution of EU trade agreements to promoting the protection of the environment and labour rights worldwide. It fosters shared ownership by all EU institutions and Member States to achieve concrete change.\nThe Communication identified actions across six policy priorities:\nThe need to be more proactive in cooperating with partners;\nStepping up a targeted and country-specific approach to TSD;\nMainstreaming sustainability beyond the TSD chapter of trade agreements;\nIncreasing monitoring of the implementation of TSD commitments;\nStrengthening the role of civil society, and;\nStrengthening enforcement by means of trade sanctions as a measure of last resort.\nCorresponding to the EU’s commitment to engage in a transparent way with citizens and stakeholders, the Commission launched on 23 July 2021 an\nopen public consultation\nto gather input on the key aspects of the review. The responses received informed the review process and helped the Commission to formulate the direction of EU TSD policy.\nAdditionally, the Commission’s services launched an\nindependent study\n, published in February 2022, which maps and compares different approaches to TSD adopted by a number of EU trade partners.\nImplementation of the Trade and Sustainable Development review\nThe Commission has been implementing the TSD review and working on the above-mentioned identified actions, as appropriate, in recently concluded agreements, agreements already in force, and agreements under negotiation. For example, since the TSD review, the EU has concluded new agreements with three partner countries with the most advanced sustainable development commitments so far: New Zealand, Chile and Kenya; all in a targeted and country-specific manner.\nLatest news\nGeneral publications\n18 February 2025\nPrior information notice: Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment in support of Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations between the EU and Thailand\nEC-TRADE/2025/OP/0002: Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment in support of Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations between the EU and Thailand\nGeneral publications\n3 February 2025\nCall for tender: Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) and Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) Compliance Support Facility\nEC-TRADE/2024/OP/0024: Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) and Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) Compliance Support Facility\n1 min read\nNews article\n12 December 2024\nEU and US host Minerals Security Partnership Forum workshop on critical minerals supply chains\nToday, the EU, the United States and other stakeholders in the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) participated in a workshop on public-private Investment in critical minerals.\n2 min read\nSee all\nLatest events\nPartner meetings\nCSD on the impact of EU FTAs on key environmental aspects, including climate\nTuesday 25 February 2025, 09:00 - 11:00 (CET)\nBrussels, Belgium\nLive streaming available\nPartner meetings\n11th meeting of the EU-Andean Civil Society Forum\nThursday 28 November 2024, 14:00 - 17:30 (CET)\nPartner meetings\nFourth meeting of the EU-Vietnam Joint Forum on TSD under the EVFTA\nThursday 21 November 2024, 09:00 - 11:00 (CET)\nLive streaming available\nSee all\nShare this page",

        "description": "Trade topics\nDispute settlement\nTo ensure the highest standards of legitimacy, transparency and neutrality, the EU has been promoting since 2015 a reformed approach to investment dispute settlement both in bilateral and multilateral investment agreements:\nIn its bilateral investment negotiations, the EU includes the Investment Court System (ICS) and more circumscribed standards of investment protection which also recognise the States’ right to regulate. The ICS is an institutionalised adjudicative body with high standards of independence, transparency and legitimacy, which replaces the old model of arbitral tribunals established\nad hoc\nfor specific disputes.\nOn the multilateral level, the EU pursues the establishment of a Multilateral Investment Court through intergovernmental discussions at the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. Once established, the Court would replace the existing old-style arbitral tribunal established under thousands of existing bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and the ICS.\nThe EU is engaged in a process of modernising the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), which includes bringing the protection rules and dispute settlement mechanism in line with the EU's modernised approach.\nThe EU implemented this new policy in the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada, and in the agreements with Vietnam, Singapore and Mexico. It also continues to pursue it in ongoing bilateral negotiations with other trading partners.\nInvestment cases against the EU/Member States\nAt the moment, the ECT is the only agreement in force containing an investor-to-state dispute settlement mechanism to which the EU is a party.\nOn 23 July 2014, the European Parliament and Council adopted a\nregulation to establish a legal and financial framework for investor-to-state dispute settlement\n. It manages any possible financial responsibility deriving from investor-to-state dispute settlement by allocating between the EU and the Member States the financial responsibility on the basis of who adopted the treatment responsible for a breach of the agreement. It also deals with who would defend a particular case.\nIn 2012, the\nEU adopted a regulation\ncreating a set of rules for bilateral investment agreements between individual EU members and non-EU countries, so as to make sure that they are consistent with EU law and with the EU’s investment policy.\nThis also requires Member States to keep the Commission informed of cases against them.\nLatest news\nNews article\n10 January 2025\nWTO confirms validity of EU climate-based actions in renewable energy dispute brought by Indonesia\nIn a ruling published today, the World Trade Organization (WTO) upheld the EU’s ability to take environmental and climate-based action under the Renewable Energy Directive (‘RED II’).\n2 min read\nPress release\n25 November 2024\nCommission challenges China’s anti-dumping tariffs on EU brandy at the WTO\nToday the European Commission has formally requested consultations at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over the provisional anti-dumping measures imposed by China on imports of EU brandy.\n1 min read\nNews article\n14 November 2024\nEU takes further action in Colombia frozen fries dispute\nToday, the EU has taken further steps to challenge Colombia’s tariffs on EU frozen fries by requesting the establishment of a compliance panel at the World Trade Organization (WTO).

        "description": "Trade topics\nDispute settlement\nThe WTO's Understanding on Dispute Settlement provides WTO members with a legal framework for resolving trade disputes that arise between them in implementing WTO agreements.\nIdeally disputes are resolved through negotiations. If this is not possible, WTO Members can request the establishment of a panel to settle the dispute. The panel will issue a report, which can subsequently be appealed before the WTO's Appellate Body on questions of law.\nThe Appellate Body is a standing body of seven persons that hears appeals from reports issued by panels in disputes brought by WTO members. The Appellate Body can uphold, modify or reverse the legal findings and conclusions of a panel\nIf a WTO member does not comply with recommendations from dispute settlement, than trade compensation or sanctions, for example in the form of increases in customs duties, may follow.\nMany WTO members, including the EU, make active use of this system so that violations of trade rules are corrected. However, the EU only initiates a dispute settlement case where other ways of finding a solution have not been productive.\nWTO disputes - Cases involving the EU\nThe Appellate Body crisis\nSince 11 December 2019, the Appellate Body is no longer able to deliver binding resolutions of trade disputes. Nor can it guarantee the right to appellate review. New appointments to the WTO's Appellate Body are blocked.\nThe EU is engaging in efforts to resolve this situation.\nEU Proposal to the WTO\nto amend the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU)\nEU Statement of 9 December 2019\nEU Statement of 15 and 16 October 2019\nThe EU has been supportive of the informal process under the auspices of the WTO General Council led by New Zealand Ambassador David Walker, who chairs the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\nMulti-party interim appeal arbitration arrangement\nPending a resolution of the Appellate Body situation, the EU and other WTO members established a Multi-party interim appeal arbitration arrangement (MPIA). The\nMPIA became effective on 30 April 2020\nand ensures that the participating WTO members continue to benefit from a functioning two-step dispute settlement system in the WTO, including the availability of an independent and impartial appeal stage. Any WTO member may join.\nThe MPIA builds on previous bilateral interim-appeal arrangements concluded between the EU,\nCanada\nand\nNorway\n.\nOn 30 July 2020, MPIA members\nestablished a pool of appeal arbitrators\nwho will hear appeals of WTO panel reports under the MPIA.\nIn March 2021, over 50 WTO members were participating in the MPIA:\nThe EU, including its Member States; Australia; Benin; Brazil; Canada; China; Chile; Colombia; Costa Rica; Ecuador; Guatemala; Hong Kong SAR; Iceland; Macao SAR; Mexico; Montenegro; New Zealand; Nicaragua; Norway; Pakistan; Peru; Singapore; Switzerland; Ukraine; and Uruguay.\nEnforcement Regulation\nAnother line of defence for the EU given the WTO situation is the\nEnforcement Regulation\n. It permits the European Commission to act on the EU's behalf in certain situations to respond to trade actions by partner countries.\nThe Enforcement Regulation also permits the EU to act should a third country block effective settlement in WTO disputes or in bilateral disputes.\nWTO reform\nThe EU is working to\nreform the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism\nto ensure that it maintains its effectiveness.\nThe reform aims to:\nMake it easier to negotiate new agreements to respond to important trade issues. ‘Plurilateral’ agreements bringing together all WTO members who want to move forward on a given issue would stop those who do not from blocking progress. Such agreements would be open to all WTO members and could be integrated into the WTO’s framework of rules later.\nFind, together with the entire WTO membership, a lasting solution to the current Appellate Body situation that would restore fully functional dispute settlement at the WTO.\nMake the WTO’s monitoring of its members’ trade policies more effective by improving the transparency of members’ trade practices and improving how WTO committees work.\nLatest news\nNews article\n10 January 2025\nWTO confirms validity of EU climate-based actions in renewable energy dispute brought by Indonesia\nIn a ruling published today, the World Trade Organization (WTO) upheld the EU’s ability to take environmental and climate-based action under the Renewable Energy Directive (‘RED II’).\n2 min read\nPress release\n25 November 2024\nCommission challenges China’s anti-dumping tariffs on EU brandy at the WTO\nToday the European Commission has formally requested consultations at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over the provisional anti-dumping measures imposed by China on imports of EU brandy.\n1 min read\nNews article\n14 November 2024\nEU takes further action in Colombia frozen fries dispute\nToday, the EU has taken further steps to challenge Colombia’s tariffs on EU frozen fries by requesting the establishment of a compliance panel at the World Trade Organization (WTO).

        "description": "Trade topics\nInvestment\nKey information about the EU framework for foreign direct investment screening\nThe objective of the EU's Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Regulation is to make sure that the EU is better equipped to identify, assess and mitigate potential risks to security or public order, while remaining among the world’s most open\ninvestment\nareas.\nIt fully applies since 11 October 2020\n.\nThe regulation\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2126 of 29 September 2021 amending the Annex\nNotification form: Request for information from the investor for the purposes of notifications pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2019/452\nFrequently asked questions on the EU framework for FDI screening\nList of screening mechanisms notified by Member States\nFactsheet - Proposal for a new regulation on the screening of foreign investments\nMain features of the EU investment screening framework\nThe EU framework for investment screening is part of the Commission's commitment to a Europe that protects its companies, workers and citizens. Due to the high degree of integration within the EU, foreign direct investment* in one Member State could pose risks to security or public order in another Member State, or in the whole Union.\nStepping up information sharing and cooperation in the EU is necessary to identify new challenges and to react accordingly. For that purpose, the new framework:\ncreates a cooperation mechanism where Member States and the Commission are able to exchange information and raise concerns related to specific investments;\nallows the Commission to issue opinions when an investment threatens the security or public order of more than one Member State, or when an investment could undermine a strategic project or programme of interest to the whole EU, such as Horizon 2020 or Galileo;\nencourages international cooperation on investment screening, including sharing experience, best practices and information on issues of common concern;\nsets certain requirements for Member States that wish to maintain or adopt a screening mechanism at national level (Member States also have the last word on whether or not a specific investment operation should be allowed on their territory), and;\ntakes into account the need to operate under short business-friendly deadlines and strong confidentiality requirements.\nFactsheet on the EU investment screening regulation\nTo improve the functioning of the cooperation mechanism set up by the EU investment screening framework, the services of the Commission, at the initiative of DG Trade, have developed\na form\nfor providing information to be submitted under the cooperation mechanism (the form is also available in a\nformat that complies with web accessibility standards\n).\nThe use of this form speeds up the examination by the 26 recipient Member States and the Commission and enables the notifying Member State to finalise its investigation without delay.\n*'Foreign direct investment' means investments of any kind by a foreign investor aiming to establish or to maintain lasting and direct links between the foreign investor and the entrepreneur to whom or the undertaking to which the capital is made available in order to carry on an economic activity in a Member State, including investments which enable effective participation in the management or control of a company carrying out an economic activity.\nRevision of the FDI Screening Regulation\nOn 24 January 2024, the Commission\nadopted five initiatives\nto strengthen the EU’s economic security at a time of growing geopolitical tensions and profound technological shifts. One of these initiatives concerns further strengthening the protection of EU security and public order by proposing improved screening of foreign investment into the EU.\nThis legislative proposal builds on the experience gained by the Commission and Member States with reviewing over 1,200 FDI transactions notified by Member States over the previous three years under the existing FDI Screening Regulation. It also builds on an\nextensive evaluation\nof the functioning of the current regulation and a recent report of the European Court of Auditors.\nThe\nlegislative proposal\naims to address existing shortcomings and improves the efficiency of the system by:\nEnsuring that all Member States have a screening mechanism in place, with better harmonised national rules.\nIdentifying minimum sectoral scope where all Member States must screen foreign investments.\nExtending EU screening to investments by EU investors that are ultimately controlled by individuals or businesses from a non-EU country.\nFactsheet - Proposal for a new regulation on the screening of foreign investments\nScreening mechanisms of Member States\nUnder the regulation, Member States may maintain their existing screening mechanisms, adopt new ones, or remain without such national mechanisms.\nThe Commission calls on those Member States that currently do not have a screening mechanism, or whose screening mechanisms do not cover all relevant FDI transactions or do not allow screening before investments are made, to urgently set up a comprehensive FDI screening mechanism. In the meantime, it calls on such Member States to use other suitable legal instruments to address cases where the acquisition or control of a particular business, infrastructure or technology would create a risk to security or public order in the EU.\nThe Commission calls on those Member States that are in the process of setting up such a screening mechanism to accelerate its adoption and prepare its implementation, including by supporting it with appropriate resources.\nThe regulation does provide for some key requirements for national screening mechanisms:\ntransparency of rules and procedures;\nnon-discrimination among foreign investors;\nconfidentiality of information exchanged;\nthe possibility of recourse against screening decisions, and;\nmeasures to identify and prevent circumvention by foreign investors.\nOn the basis of notifications by Member States pursuant to the regulation, the Commission publishes an up-to-date list of screening laws in the EU.\nConsult the list of screening mechanisms notified by Member States\nAnnual reports\nThe regulation requires the Commission to submit a report on the implementation of the regulation to the European Parliament and to the Council on a yearly basis.\nThe Commission’s fourth 'Report on the Screening of Foreign Direct Investments into the Union' was adopted on 17 October 2024. The report includes:\nfigures and trends for FDI into the EU;\nlegislative developments in Member States;\nscreening activities by Member States, and;\nan assessment of the EU cooperation mechanism on FDI screening in 2023.\nThe report also has a Staff Working Document with more economic data on foreign investments as well as additional details on the legislative developments in all Member States.\nFourth annual report on the screening of foreign direct investments into the Union\n(2023)\nAnnual reports on the screening of foreign direct investments into the Union\nGroup of experts on screening foreign direct investment\nThe Commission in 2017 established a group of experts from Member States. The objective of the group is to discuss issues relating to investment screening, share best practices and lessons learned, and exchange views on trends and issues of common concern relating to foreign investments. Pursuant to Article 12 of the new\nregulation\n, the group may also discuss systemic issues relating to the implementation of the regulation.\nCommission Decision of 29.11.2017\nsetting up the group of experts on the screening of foreign direct investments into the European Union C(2017)7866 final\nRegister of Commission Expert Groups\nData protection under the EU investment screening mechanism\nJoint Controllership Arrangement (JCA)\nUnder the EU cooperation mechanism set up by the FDI Screening Regulation, Member States and the Commission exchange information about foreign direct investments. This may involve the processing of personal data (e.g. names and addresses of natural persons involved in a transaction).\nHence, the Member States and the Commission have concluded a Joint Controllership Arrangement (JCA) in line with data protection rules, notably the\nGDPR\n(Article 26), the\nEDPR\n(Article 28) and the\nEU FDI Screening Regulation\n(Article 14) and the underlying\nCommission Decision\n. The JCA is an agreement between Member States and the Commission on the processing of these personal data. It sets out the allocation of the respective roles, responsibilities and practical arrangements between Member States and the Commission: both being joint controllers of these data.\nThe document entered into force on 28 April 2022. The main elements of the JCA are available in the\nEU Register of the Data Protection Officer\n(DPO).\nPrivacy statement on protecting and processing personal data in the context of implementing the EU's Investment Screening Regulation\nCommission Decision (EU) 2020/1502 of 15 October 2020 laying down internal rules concerning the provision of information to data subjects and the restriction of certain of their rights in the context of the processing of personal data by the Commission in the cooperation mechanism established by Regulation (EU) 2019/452 of the European Parliament and of the Council\nJoint Controllership Arrangement with regard to processing of personal data in the context of the cooperation mechanism under Regulation (EU) 2019/452 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 March 2019 establishing a framework for the screening of foreign direct investments into the Union\nInternational cooperation on investment screening\nThe regulation encourages Member States and the Commission to cooperate with the responsible authorities of like-minded third countries on issues relating to the screening of foreign direct investments on grounds of security and public order.\nSuch administrative cooperation should aim to strengthen the effectiveness of the framework for screening of investment by Member States and the cooperation between Member States and the Commission. The EU pursues international cooperation bilaterally or in a wider format.\nIn particular, the EU is supporting the ongoing work of the OECD on\nInvestment policies related to national security and public order\n.\nSince 2021, cooperation with the US on investment screening is also ongoing in Working Group 8 of the Trade and Technology Council (TTC). Stakeholders may provide inputs on\nFuturium\n, which is a virtual space for businesses, public authorities, innovators, researchers, civil society, and policymakers to shape the EU and US discussions in the Trade and Technology Council together.\nEU-US Trade and Technology Council Inaugural Joint Statement\n(Pittsburgh, 29 September 2021)\nWebsite of the TTC\nInvestment Screening Working Group on Futurium\nMore on Investment screening\n2022 OECD Report assessing the framework for screening foreign direct investment into the EU\n2022\nGuidance for Member States\nconcerning foreign direct investment from Russia and Belarus in view of the military aggression against Ukraine and the restrictive measures laid down in recent Council Regulations on sanctions.\n2020\nGuidance for Member States\non how to use foreign direct investment (FDI) screening in times of public health crisis and economic vulnerability in the EU\n2019\nStudy on the foreign ownership of EU firms\n2017 Communication on Welcoming Foreign Direct Investment while Protecting Essential Interests\nLatest news\nPress release\n15 January 2025\nCommission calls on Member States to review outbound investments and assess risks to economic security\nThe Commission has today published a Recommendation calling on EU Member States to review outbound investments of their companies into non-EU countries.

It would build on the EU's groundbreaking approach to its bilateral FTAs and be a major departure from the system of investor-to-state dispute settlement (ISDS) based on ad hoc commercial arbitration.\nA Multilateral Investment Court, like the approach in the FTAs, would bring the key features of domestic and international courts to investment adjudication.\nThe idea is that the Multilateral Investment Court would:\nhave a first instance tribunal;\nhave an appeal tribunal;\nhave tenured, highly qualified judges, obliged to adhere to the strictest ethical standards, and a dedicated secretariat;\nbe a permanent body;\nwork transparently;\nrule on disputes arising under future and existing investment treaties;\nonly apply where an investment treaty already explicitly allows an investor to bring a dispute against a state;\nwould not create new possibilities for an investor to bring a dispute against a state;\nprevent disputing parties from choosing which judges rule on their case;\nprovide for effective enforcement of its decisions, and;\nbe open to all interested countries to join.\nFor the EU, the Multilateral Investment Court would replace the bilateral investment court systems included in EU trade and investment agreements.\nBoth the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) and the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement foresee setting up a permanent multilateral mechanism and contain a reference to it.\nThe EU now includes similar provisions in all of its negotiations involving investment.\nWhy do we need a Multilateral Investment Court?\nThe EU is the world’s largest exporter and importer of foreign direct investment. Investment, both inward and outward, brings jobs and economic growth. That’s why encouraging and retaining investments is vital for ensuring economic growth and jobs in the EU.\nInternational investment rules and international investment dispute settlement have a role to play in encouraging and retaining investment. So it’s in the EU’s interest to ensure that the resolution of investment disputes operates effectively on an international level.\nThe EU is pursuing a modern and reformed approach to investment dispute resolution. However, most of the over 3,200 existing investment agreements – including the over 1,400 agreements concluded by EU Member States – don’t contain the innovations and improvements the EU has developed in its recent investment negotiations. The Multilateral Investment Court would have the potential to replace the dispute settlement provisions included in those older agreements.\nWhere are we at EU level?\nThe\nCommission's objectives\nfor the Multilateral Investment Court are based on the approach developed in the EU's bilateral free trade agreements and agreed by the other EU Institutions and all EU Member States.\nIn the European Commission’s 2014 public consultation on investment protection, some stakeholders already proposed reforming investment dispute resolution multilaterally as a more effective way to reform the ISDS system than bilateral reforms.\nIn its Concept Paper of 5 May 2015 on ‘\nInvestment in TTIP – the path beyond\n’, the Commission also indicated that work should start on setting up a multilateral system for resolving international investment disputes. This work would be carried out in parallel to the reform process undertaken in bilateral EU negotiations.\nThe European Parliament, too, has supported the proposal to work towards a multilateral solution (such as in its\nresolution\nof 8 July 2015 containing the European Parliament’s recommendations to the European Commission on the negotiations for TTIP).\nThe Commission’s\nTrade for All communication\nof 2015 also sets the objective of engaging with partners to build consensus for a fully-fledged, permanent Multilateral Investment Court so as to develop a coherent, unified and effective policy on investment dispute resolution.\nOn 1 August 2016, the EU launched an\nimpact assessment process\non options for multilateral reform of the investment dispute settlement system, including the possible establishment of a multilateral investment court.\nOn 20 March 2018, the Council\nadopted and published\nthe\nnegotiating directives\nfor a multilateral investment court.\nNews and developments\nMany countries are currently engaged in internal reflections on their policies on investment protection and investment dispute settlement. The Commission is engaging with them on an exploratory basis.\nRelevant documents\nDocuments and other content related to the European Commission's work to establish a Multilateral Investment Court\n.\nContact\nPlease write to us at the following address:\nTRADE-F2-MULTILAT-INVEST-DS\nec\n[dot]\neuropa\n[dot]\neu\n(TRADE-F2-MULTILAT-INVEST-DS[at]ec[dot]europa[dot]eu)\nLatest news\nNews article\n29 January 2021\nEU and Canada adopt rules putting in place CETA investment court\nToday, the EU and Canada adopted four decisions putting in place the Investment Court System provisions agreed in CETA.\n1 min read\nNews article\n11 October 2019\nCommission presents procedural proposals for Investment Court System in CETA\nThe European Commission today presented to the Council four proposals for specific rules putting in place the Investment Court System (ICS) provisions in the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA).\n2 min read\nNews article\n20 March 2018\nCommission welcomes adoption of negotiating directives for a multilateral investment court\nThe Commission welcomes today’s adoption by the Council of the negotiating directives for a multilateral investment court, as well as the fact that for the first time the Council makes its negotiating mandate public right at the time it is adopted.\n2 min read\nSee all\nLatest events\nPartner meetings\nStakeholder meeting on the establishment of a multilateral investment court\nThursday 18 January 2024, 11:00 - 12:00 (CET)\nOnline only\nLive streaming available\nPartner meetings\nStakeholder meeting on the establishment of a Multilateral Investment Court\nThursday 5 October 2023, 10:00 - 11:00 (CEST)\nOnline only\nLive streaming available\nPartner meetings\nStakeholder meeting on the establishment of a Multilateral Investment Court\nWednesday 22 March 2023, 16:00 - 17:00 (CET)\nOnline only\nLive streaming available\nSee all\nShare this page",

        "description": "Trade topics\nEnforcement and protection\nTrade defence\nTrade policy\nRegulation 2023/2675\non the protection of the European Union and its Member States from economic coercion (the Anti-Coercion Instrument) enables the EU to take action in cases of economic coercion of the EU or its Member States by non-EU countries. The objective is to deter coercion, and if necessary, to respond to it.\nUnder the regulation, ‘economic coercion' refers to a situation whereby a third country seeks to pressure the European Union or an EU Member State into making a particular choice by applying, or threatening to apply, measures affecting trade or investment.\nSuch practices unduly interfere with the legitimate sovereign choices of the European Union and its Member States.\nWhether a third-country measure fulfils those conditions will be determined on a case-by-case basis.\nEconomic coercion directed against the European Union or an EU Member State may affect any policy field and may take the form of legislation, or other formal or informal action or inaction. The instrument and the EU’s policy apply irrespective of the source of the coercion, and thus irrespective of the identity of the third country.\nEU action under the Anti-Coercion Instrument\nThe\nregulation\nsets out a framework for EU action against economic coercion, in line with public international law, and sets out a number of procedures to be followed, including timelines.\nExamination\nFollowing a request or on its own initiative, the European Commission first examines the existence of economic coercion in an individual case.\nAny actor affected by or concerned about potential coercion may submit to the Commission information on incidents of economic coercion, or a duly substantiated request for examination of a third-country measure,\nhere\n. The Commission will ensure the protection of any confidential information which may be submitted.\nThe Commission is required to act expeditiously and should complete the examination as soon as possible, normally within four months.\nDetermination\nFollowing a formal proposal from the Commission, the Council determines the existence of economic coercion via an implementing act. The Council should act expeditiously. It has a maximum of 8 to 10 weeks to complete this step. Once coercion has been determined, the Commission requests the coercing third country to stop the coercion.\nEngagement\nOn behalf of the EU, the Commission will engage in consultations with the coercing third country with a view to resolving the issue, provided that the third country engages in good faith. The EU would explore appropriate avenues such as direct negotiations, mediations, arbitration, good offices, and adjudication.\nResponse measures\nIf those efforts do not bear fruit, and in view of set deadlines, the Commission may, as a last resort, adopt EU response measures to counteract the coercion, with a view to inducing the third country to stop its coercion.\nThe types of measure which the Commission may take include restrictions on the access to the EU market and other economic disadvantages for the third country involved. The list of options is broad, and covers areas such as trade in goods, services, foreign direct investment, financial markets, public procurement, trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, export controls, and more. The Commission acts by way of an implementing act, once Member States have given their views in an examination procedure.\nAdditionally, the Commission may deploy appropriate measures with regard to the granting of Union funding. For more information, see the Commission's\nCommunication to the European Parliament and the European Council on the Commission’s proposal for an anti-coercion instrument\n.\nBefore the imposition of EU response measures, the Commission carries out consultations in order to select appropriate measures in individual cases, where applicable. Those concerned, such as economic operators, business associations, consumers, are encouraged to participate. The Member States’ views also inform the selection and design of any measure. Information in any specific case will be provided in the Official Journal of the EU, and on DG Trade's website.\nThe Commission\nterminates\nthe Union response measures as soon as they are no longer needed.\nThe Union may also decide to request\nreparation for\nthe injury\ncaused by the economic coercion, in line with public international law.\nInternational cooperation\nThe EU cooperates with other countries affected by the same or similar coercive practices, in individual cases.\nAt all times, the EU engages with partners in efforts to address the issue of economic coercion more generally.  This engagement currently takes place at the G7 (see\nG7 Hiroshima Leaders’ Communiqué\nand\nG7 Leaders’ Statement on Economic Resilience and Economic Security\nof 20 May 2023), and also bilaterally, with for example the United States and Japan.\nSingle point of contact\nA\nsingle point of contact\nis available for any stakeholder interested in the application of this regulation.\nFurther information\nAnti-Coercion Instrument (legislative text):\nRegulation 2023/2675\non the protection of the European Union and its Member States from economic coercion\nPress Release:\nNew tool to enable EU to withstand economic coercion enters into force\n(27 December 2023)\nQ&A\nRelated statements and documents\nTune in to trade policy insights\n19 December 2024\nEpisode 10\nTom Moylan meets the new Trade and Economic Security Commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, to discuss Mercosur, tariffs, and trust.\n19/12/2024 | Episode 10 | 29 minutes\n14 November 2024\nEpisode 9\nDo you care about where our goods come from?

In the 2015 ‘\nTrade for All\n’ Communication, it committed itself to continue promoting an ambitious global health agenda and better access to medicines in poor countries.\nEU trade policy and access to medicines\nThe Commission actions address issues like affordability, availability, and safety and quality, by supporting:\nglobal health organisations and initiatives – for example by contributing to the\nUnited Nations High Level Panel\non Access to Medicines;\nlow- and middle-income countries’ public health systems – for example by financing a Partnership to strengthen pharmaceutical systems and improve access to quality medicines in 15 African ACP countries;\nresearch and development of medicines to combat poverty-related and neglected infectious diseases – the Commission is the world’s third largest public funder of R&D, providing €905 million from 2007-2013 and €365 million from 2014-2015, and;\ntrade rules facilitating access - for example, the EU has eliminated tariffs for medicines because they act as a tax and make the medicines more expensive.\nCheck for\nkey actions to support access to medicines\n.

In 2016 the Commission evaluated this legislation as part of its REFIT regulatory fitness and performance programme.\nThe Regulation was part of a 2001 EU strategy to boost measures aimed at tackling HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the drive to reduce poverty. It addresses a specific issue as part of the wider strategy and the evaluation found that it has made a small contribution to stimulating tiered pricing policies.\nThe evaluation concludes that the Regulation still has a role to play in efforts to target major diseases together with all the other Commission measures described above, in the context of aiming to continue to promote an ambitious global health agenda and better access to medicines in poor countries.\nEvaluation of Council Regulation (EC) 953/2003 to avoid trade diversion into the EU of certain key medicines:\nEvaluation of the regulation\nConclusions of the evaluation\nCommission staff working document\nMore on Council Regulation (EC) 953/2003\nRegulation text\nProducts registered under the Regulation\nInstructions for pharmaceutical companies wishing to use the Regulation\nReports on volumes exported under tiered prices\nTune in to trade policy insights\n19 December 2024\nEpisode 10\nTom Moylan meets the new Trade and Economic Security Commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, to discuss Mercosur, tariffs, and trust.\n19/12/2024 | Episode 10 | 29 minutes\n14 November 2024\nEpisode 9\nDo you care about where our goods come from?

        "description": "Trade topics\nIntellectual property\nThe primary function of intellectual property rights (IPRs) is to protect and stimulate the development and distribution of new products and the provision of new services based on the creation and exploitation of inventions, trademarks, designs, creative content or other intangible\nassets\n. This is especially important for start-ups and SMEs, as IPRs provide them with powerful tools to compete with incumbent or larger companies.\nEUIPO, through the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights, has published several EU-wide\nstudies and reports\nthat show the significant contribution of IPR to the EU economy.\nIPRs also have other benefits for their holders and for the public, including:\nEnabling indirect revenues\nWhere a company protects its products or processes with IPRs, it can derive revenues not only from direct marketing but also from licensing the IPRs to third parties that manufacture and commercialise the products, in exchange for a fee or royalty. These additional indirect revenues sometimes exceed the profits resulting from the direct exploitation, particularly as they do not require additional internal manufacturing capacities.\nSuch an approach may therefore be particularly relevant for SMEs. It is also important for universities and public research centres, which do not usually have the necessary production facilities themselves.\nPromotion of culture\nIn the creative sectors, such as the publishing, music or film industries, copyright enables authors, performers, producers and other creators to obtain an economic reward in return for their creations and activities, which enrich cultural heritage, enhance cultural diversity, and benefit society at large.\nDissemination of technical information\nEven where a company, university or research institution does not intend to exploit its own patented inventions, any member of the public, including researchers, can still make use of patent information.\nPatents are the most prolific and up-to-date source of technological information, and contain detailed technical information which often cannot be found anywhere else: it is estimated that up to 80% of current technical knowledge can only be found in patent documents. Moreover, this information is rapidly available, as most patent applications are published 18 months after the first filing.\nSearches in patent literature can be conducted by anyone, by using for instance the free-of-charge\nEspacenet patent database\n. The latter provides access to more than 60 million patent documents from all over the world, classified by technological area.\nThere are good reasons to search patent literature:\nAvoid duplication of R&D efforts and spending (it is estimated that up to 30% of all expenditure in R&D is wasted on redeveloping existing inventions).\nFind solutions to technical problems (most patents – around 85% – are no longer in force, making a vast number of inventions available for free).\nGather business intelligence, as patents not only reveal technological information, but also make it possible, at a very early stage, to identify potential competitors, customers and partners, or to monitor competitors' innovation strategies.\nFacilitating technology transfer\nPatents are often not just a convenient means of protecting an invention, but they also describe in a very accurate way technologies which are the subject of technology transfer and similar agreements (licensing, assignment, etc.). This 'technology packaging' / trade facilitation function justifies that patents have sometimes been considered as the 'currency' of the knowledge-based economy. To some extent, the same reasoning also applies to IPRs other than patents.\n'Open source' relies on IPR\nOpen source mechanisms are popular in sectors such as software (e.g. General Public Licences or GPLs). While the common perception is that such mechanisms are characterised by the absence of any IP protection, it is worth noting that a typical GPL actually relies on IPRs, as it is typically a copyright licence that remains valid as long as certain conditions are complied with. Flexibilities enjoyed by the licensee must be passed on to subsequent users, even where the software is modified.\nCollateral to obtain financing\nAs intangible assets, IPRs often play an instrumental role for SMEs (including start-ups and spin-offs) trying to convince third parties to provide them with financing (such investing equity or granting loans). For the financial sector, the valuation of a patent, for instance, is crucial to valorise intangible assets, especially for knowledge-intensive SMEs.\nProviding guarantees regarding the quality and safety of products\nMany counterfeit products do not comply with the applicable safety standards, and put the health of safety of Europeans – including children – at risk (for instance, where vehicle spare parts, toys or pharmaceutical products are concerned). Enforcing IPRs such as trademarks and designs with respect to such products prevents their entry into the market and ensures that consumers can rely on the quality and safety of genuine products made by the original manufacturer.\nLatest news\nPress release\n20 January 2025\nEU challenges China at WTO on royalties for EU high-tech sector\nThe European Commission has requested consultations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) aiming to remove unfair and illegal trade practices by China in the sphere of intellectual property.\n1 min read\nNews article\n17 May 2023\nCommission releases its Report on Intellectual Property Rights in Third Countries\nThe European Commission published today its biennial Report on the Protection and Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in third countries.

The EU needs to protect these intangible assets for growth and competitiveness.\nEnforcing IPRs within the EU and abroad protects EU growth and jobs. When European ideas, brands and products are pirated and counterfeited, EU jobs are affected.\nCounterfeit products can put at risk consumer safety and health, and can harm the environment. The EU supports strong IPR standards to tackle IPR infringements in the EU and abroad.\nRights holders need access to effective ways of protecting their rights internationally. They need a solid and predictable legal framework on IPR.\nEU trade policy and intellectual property\nThe EU seeks to improve the protection and enforcement of intellectual property (IP) rights in third countries. It pursues this objective in different ways:\nAn effective enforcement regime: The EU has adopted a revised\nStrategy for the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights in Third Countries\n. It includes specific measures to address IPR protection and enforcement problems affecting European businesses trading and investing abroad.\nMultilateral agreements: The EU is part of the\nWorld Trade Organization\nand the\nWorld Intellectual Property Organization\n, to help improve the protection and enforcement of IP rights. The EU is a key supporter of the\nAgreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights\n(TRIPS).\nBilateral trade agreements: The EU negotiates and has already concluded a series of\nbilateral trade agreements\n, which include comprehensive IPR chapters. As far as possible, the IPR chapters should offer similar levels of protection to that of the EU. Yet the EU does take into account the level of development of the country concerned.\nOther bilateral activities: The Commission engages in regular meetings on IP matters (such as IP Dialogues, IP Working Groups, etc.) with priority partner countries around the world.\nThe EU also conducts other support actions as part of its IP Strategy:\nTechnical cooperation programmes to help third countries improve their IPR systems.\nSupport services for EU rights holders doing business in or with certain third countries – namely the\nIPR SME Helpdesk\n, in China, Latin America and Southeast Asia. IPR SME Helpdesks provide information and advice to SMEs on intellectual property rights (IPR) in these regions.\nEnforcing intellectual property rights in EU trade policy\nThe EU's current\nstrategy to enforce intellectual property rights in non-EU countries\nhas been in place since 2014. The objective is to promote better intellectual property standards in non-EU countries and stop trade in IPR-infringing goods.\nThe Commission regularly conducts surveys on the enforcement of intellectual property rights. The report gives EU rights' holders information on the effectiveness of IPR regimes in countries outside the EU.\nIt also lets rights holders improve their business strategies and operations to protect their intellectual property. They can better manage risk around their IPRs when doing business in, or with, certain non-EU countries.\nThis assessment also helps the EU define certain countries where the protection and/or enforcement of intellectual property are detrimental to EU interests.\nThe report also benefits non-EU country authorities' understanding of the perception of EU users of their IPR systems, particularly potential areas for improvement.\nReport of latest IPR survey (2023)\nCounterfeit and Piracy Watch-List\nThe EU's Counterfeit and Piracy Watch List helps identify the marketplaces outside the EU where counterfeiting, piracy or other forms of intellectual property abuse are common practice.\nAfter conducting a\npublic consultation\n, the Commission published the third edition of its Counterfeit and Piracy Watch List.

        "description": "Trade topics\nAnti-dumping\nTrade defence\nWhat is an anti-dumping investigation?\nAn anti-dumping investigation is when the Commission tries to determine whether goods being imported into the EU are being sold at below the price in the producer country, i.e. being 'dumped'.\nThe Commission is obliged to launch an anti-dumping investigation if it receives a valid complaint from an EU industry providing sufficient evidence that exporting producers from one or more countries are dumping a particular product onto the EU market and causing injury to the EU industry. In accordance with EU law, the Commission launches the investigation within 45 days.\nThe Commission publishes a Notice of Initiation in the EU's Official Journal, specifying the product under investigation, the country/countries to be investigated, the rights and obligations of interested parties to the proceeding, and the deadlines which will apply.\nThe investigation examines whether:\ndumping is taking place from the country/countries concerned;\nmaterial injury has been suffered by the EU industry;\nit is the dumping that is causing the injury, and/or;\nit would be against the economic interests of the EU to impose measures (which are usually in the form of an anti-dumping duty).\nWhat are the main stages of the investigation?\nOn the date the Notice of Initiation is published, the Commission makes questionnaires available on its website for:\nexporters in the countries concerned;\nproducers in the EU, and;\nimporters and users in the EU.\nOnce companies have replied to the questionnaires sent to them, the data is verified by case officers (usually by inspecting records at the company's premises).\nThe Commission then makes provisional findings. At this point it may:\nimpose provisional anti-dumping duties (in force for a maximum of six months);\ncontinue the investigation without imposing duties, or;\nterminate the investigation.\nAll interested parties have the right to comment on the provisional findings and receive disclosure of the essential facts and considerations forming the basis for the provisional findings. The Commission takes due account of the comments received when it continues the investigation. The definitive findings are also disclosed to interested parties and comments requested.\nFinally, the Commission either:\nimposes definitive measures, or;\nterminates the case without measures.\nThe Commission must impose any measures within 14 months of the initiation of the investigation.\nIs it necessary to employ a lawyer?\nThere is no obligation to employ a lawyer. A company may defend its own interests during an investigation. The Commission's services are available throughout the investigation to help any interested party and contact details are provided.\nWhat if a company does not reply to the questionnaire?\nParties who do not reply to the questionnaire or do not cooperate in other ways may be regarded as not cooperating with the investigation.\nCooperation is strongly encouraged. The consequences of non-cooperation normally lead to the imposition of measures which are higher than for parties which have cooperated.\nLatest news\nNews article\n11 April 2025\nEU takes action against dumped imports of food flavour enhancer\nThe European Commission has extended its anti-dumping measures on imports of monosodium glutamate (MSG) from China, to cover imports from Malaysia.\n1 min read\nNews article\n25 March 2025\nCommission strengthens protection for EU steel industry\nThe European Commission has tightened the steel safeguard measure to shield the EU steel industry from surging imports, delivering on the EU's Steel and Metals Action Plan.\n1 min read\nNews article\n24 March 2025\nCommission starts tracking imports of industrial chemicals rapidly filling the EU market\nThe Commission has started monitoring the import volumes of certain ethylene and ammonia products, which are mainly used for fertiliser production and industrial applications.\n1 min read\nSee all\nLatest events\nPartner meetings\nCivil Society Dialogue on the EU’s Trade defence instruments – Annual Report 2023\nThursday 26 September 2024, 14:30 - 16:30 (CEST)\nLive streaming available\nPartner meetings\nCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2022\nMonday 25 September 2023, 11:00 - 13:00 (CEST)\nOnline only\nLive streaming available\nPartner meetings\nCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2021\nThursday 24 November 2022, 14:00 - 16:00 (CET)\nOnline only\nLive streaming available\nSee all\nShare this page",

        "description": "Trade topics\nAnti-dumping\nTrade defence\nInterim review\nWhat is an interim review?\nAnti-dumping measures are usually imposed for five years. However, interested parties may ask for a review during that time:\nany exporter, importer or Community producer: once the measures have been in force for one year.\nan EU country or the Commission itself: at any time.\nAn interim review can be ‘full’ – covering dumping, injury and Community interest – or ‘partial’ – limited to dumping, for example.\nHow to ask for an interim review\nContact us in writing, stating the reasons for the review and providing sufficient evidence of the need for a review.\nFor example, an exporter may claim that its cost structure has changed due to new investments and that this has resulted in a reduced rate of dumping.\nIf a request for review is accepted, the Commission publishes a Notice of Initiation in the EU’s Official Journal and sends out questionnaires to interested parties, just as in the original investigation. The review must be concluded within 15 months.\nWhat aspects does an interim review cover?\nMost often the request concerns the level of the duty in force.\nFor instance, an exporter may claim that the amount of dumping has fallen. The duty would be recalculated only if the change is lasting and the dumping margin is not likely to increase again in future.\nOther forms of review can also be considered such as for injury, scope and form of measures.\nNew Exporter Review\nWhat is a new exporter review?\nAnti-dumping measures are usually imposed for five years.\nImports from companies that cooperated with the investigation are usually liable for their own individual duty, but there is also a 'country-wide' duty for imports from all other companies producing and exporting the product concerned to the EU, which will often be higher than the individual duty.\nIf a company starts exporting the product to the EU after the investigation, then its goods will be subject to the 'country-wide' duty.\nHow to ask for a new exporter review\nCompanies that either did not exist, or did not export to the EU during the original investigation, can request a new exporter review to have their own individual duty rate established.\nTo qualify as a 'new exporter', a company must fulfil these three criteria:\nIt did not export the product concerned to the EU during the original investigation period;\nit is not related to any exporter or producer subject to the measures imposed, and;\nit has exported the product to the EU since the original investigation, or is contractually bound (irrevocably) to export a significant quantity to the EU.\nIf a company appears to meet the above criteria, a review will be opened. The review will investigate whether the criteria are met and if so establish an individual margin of dumping for the company concerned. Specific rules apply when the applicable duty was established on the basis of a sample of exporting producers.\nInterested parties wishing to claim to be treated as a new exporter should contact us for more information on the procedure.\nAbsorption\nDuties are said to be absorbed when, after anti-dumping or countervailing duties have been imposed, export prices decrease or the resale prices of the imported goods do not increase sufficiently, so the measures do not have the expected effect.\nWhat is an anti-absorption re-investigation?\nWhen there is evidence of duties being absorbed, the original trade defence investigation may be re-opened at the request of any interested party (EU producer, exporter, importer, user), EU country or the Commission. The re-investigation is initiated by publishing a Notice in the EU’s Official Journal, normally within two years of the original measures being imposed. It should take no more than nine months to complete.\nWhat can be done?\nThe re-investigation gives exporters, importers, EU producers and users the opportunity to explain the export prices and EU resale prices. If the conclusion is that the duties should have resulted in price changes that did not take place, the dumping margins can be recalculated and the duties increased up to double the rate of the original duty.\nWhat law is applied here?\nArticle 12 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 19(3) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation.\nHow to proceed\nAny interested party EU industry, exporter, importer, user and which finds evidence of absorption of duties, can either lodge a complaint with the European Commission (Directorate General for Trade, Directorate H) or inform national authorities, who may ask for the investigation to be reopened.\nCircumvention of measures\nIn essence, circumvention is any activity designed to avoid the payment of anti-dumping or countervailing duties imposed on a particular product manufactured in and/or exported from a non-EU country.\nThese practices can best be understood through examples:\nslightly modifying a product so that it can be classified under a combined nomenclature (CN) code that is not subject to duties, or;\nfalsely declaring that a product originated in a country not subject to duties, or;\nexporting through a producer with a lower duty rate, or;\nexporting a product in parts and having it assembled in the EU, where the parts are not subject to duties, or;\ncertain assembly operations in non-EU countries.\nFor a practice to qualify as circumvention, there must also be evidence that:\nEU industry is being harmed or the duty’s effects are being undermined in terms of prices and/or quantities of the product in question, and;\nthere is evidence that the imported product is being dumped, or;\nevidence that the imported product and/or parts thereof still benefit from the subsidy.\nWhen is assembly in the EU considered circumvention?\nThree criteria must be met:\nThe assembly began – or substantially increased – after or just before an anti-dumping investigation, and the parts imported into the EU come from the country subject to duties, and;\nThe imported parts represent 60% or more of the value of all parts of the assembled product. However, if the value added in the EU to the imported parts represents more than 25% of the manufacturing cost, this is no longer considered assembly and there is no circumvention, and;\nThe assembled product undermines the effects of the duty and there is evidence of dumping.\nThe same rules apply to assembly operations in non-EU countries.\nIf a company is circumventing the duties in force, what can be done?\nThe Commission may open an investigation if:\nan interested party provides sufficient evidence of circumvention, or;\nan EU country makes a request, and;\nthe Commission believes one is warranted.\nThe first step in an investigation is the publication of a Regulation in the EU’s Official Journal. Customs authorities will then begin registering all imports alleged to be circumventing the measures. This enables them to impose a duty retroactively, should circumvention be found.\nWhat is the result of the investigation?\nIf it is determined that circumvention has taken place, the duties in force will be extended to imports from the country or company found to be circumventing them. The duties then apply retroactively from the date on which the investigation began.\nWhat about exporters in the country concerned that are not circumventing the duties?\nThe Regulation opening the investigation clearly states that companies not engaging in circumvention must contact the Commission by a specific deadline and provide information and evidence proving that they are not related to any producer subject to measures nor engaged in circumvention themselves.\nThe Commission can then propose that individual companies be exempted from registration of their imports and/or the extension of duties.\nIn the case of anti-dumping proceedings, when circumvention takes place in the EU, exemptions may be also granted to importers.\nExpiry review\nWhat is an expiry review?\nAnti-dumping measures are usually imposed for five years. They expire automatically, unless a review determines that if they were to expire, dumping and injury would probably continue or recur.\nThis 'expiry review' is usually requested by producers in the EU – although it can also be launched on the initiative of the Commission – and must include evidence that the expiry of measures would be likely to result in a continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury.\nThis can be demonstrated by evidence that:\ndumping and injury are continuing\nthe removal of injury is only due to the measures in force\nfurther dumping and injury are likely if the measures are allowed to expire.\nWhat is the procedure?\nDuring the final year the measures are in force, the Commission publishes a Notice of Impending Expiry in the EU’s Official Journal stating that they will expire on a given date. If EU producers wish to request a review, they must do so no later than three months before the date on which the measures are set to expire.\nIf a substantiated review request is received, the Commission publishes a Notice of Initiation and begins investigating whether dumping and injury are likely to continue or recur. Normally, expiry reviews are completed within 12 months, but they may take up to 15 months.\nThe guide '\nHow to make an anti-dumping complaint\n' (available in all official EU languages) contains a specific section giving guidance to EU industry on how to prepare an expiry review request.\nIf no review is requested, the Commission publishes a Notice of Expiry announcing that the measures will lapse.\nWhat can be the result?\nAn expiry review can result only in the repeal or continuation of the duties in force. If measures are maintained, they will normally remain in force for another five years. An expiry review cannot lead to a change in the level or form of the duties; these can only be changed by an interim review\nChanges of name, address or legal status for companies subject to an individual duty\nCompanies subject to an individual duty and mentioned by name in the operative part of an anti-dumping regulation – that change their name and/or address, should contact us immediately.\nIf the name and address details in the regulation imposing the measures are not identical to the name and address on the export documents, difficulties may arise with customs formalities.\nThe Commission will verify the data and inform the company if it needs more information. Details of the new name/address will be published in the EU’s Official Journal.\nCompanies undergoing a more complex structural change such as a merger or takeover should also contact us to determine whether the changes require a change of name or a partial interim review.\nLatest news\nNews article\n11 April 2025\nEU takes action against dumped imports of food flavour enhancer\nThe European Commission has extended its anti-dumping measures on imports of monosodium glutamate (MSG) from China, to cover imports from Malaysia.\n1 min read\nNews article\n25 March 2025\nCommission strengthens protection for EU steel industry\nThe European Commission has tightened the steel safeguard measure to shield the EU steel industry from surging imports, delivering on the EU's Steel and Metals Action Plan.\n1 min read\nNews article\n24 March 2025\nCommission starts tracking imports of industrial chemicals rapidly filling the EU market\nThe Commission has started monitoring the import volumes of certain ethylene and ammonia products, which are mainly used for fertiliser production and industrial applications.\n1 min read\nSee all\nLatest events\nPartner meetings\nCivil Society Dialogue on the EU’s Trade defence instruments – Annual Report 2023\nThursday 26 September 2024, 14:30 - 16:30 (CEST)\nLive streaming available\nPartner meetings\nCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2022\nMonday 25 September 2023, 11:00 - 13:00 (CEST)\nOnline only\nLive streaming available\nPartner meetings\nCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2021\nThursday 24 November 2022, 14:00 - 16:00 (CET)\nOnline only\nLive streaming available\nSee all\nShare this page",

        "description": "Trade topics\nAnti-dumping\nTrade defence\nDuties\nAnti-dumping investigations may result in anti-dumping duties to offset injurious dumping. The duties are imposed when the products in question are imported from the non-EU country(ies).\nThe rate of duty for each case is based on the dumping margin, unless a lower rate would remove the injury ('lesser duty rule').\nWith regard to anti-dumping duties, the EU may choose to impose one or more of three basic forms:\nad valorem duty – a percentage of the net, free-at-EU frontier (CIF) price. This is the most common form of duty;\nspecific duty – a fixed value for a certain amount of goods, e.g. €100 per tonne of a product, and/or;\nvariable duty – a minimum import price (MIP). Importers in the EU do not pay an anti-dumping duty if the foreign exporter’s export price to the EU is higher than the MIP.\nUpon request from individual exporters, a company-specific price undertaking may also be accepted. This is a commitment by an exporter to respect minimum import prices (MIPs). This commitment is not meant to fix prices at specific levels, rather to prevent them from falling below a certain floor price. To avoid any restriction of fair competition, the content of such undertakings is not made public.\nPrice undertakings are governed by Article 8 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation (which draws on Article 8 of the WTO anti-dumping Agreement).\nOnce the Commission accepts an undertaking, the company’s products are exempt from anti-dumping duties that would otherwise be charged when they are entered for free circulation.\nPrice undertakings are closely monitored by the Commission.\nSpecial rules for developing countries are contained in Article 15 of the WTO Anti-dumping agreement and for EU candidate countries in the Essen Declaration.\nLatest news\nNews article\n11 April 2025\nEU takes action against dumped imports of food flavour enhancer\nThe European Commission has extended its anti-dumping measures on imports of monosodium glutamate (MSG) from China, to cover imports from Malaysia.\n1 min read\nNews article\n25 March 2025\nCommission strengthens protection for EU steel industry\nThe European Commission has tightened the steel safeguard measure to shield the EU steel industry from surging imports, delivering on the EU's Steel and Metals Action Plan.\n1 min read\nNews article\n24 March 2025\nCommission starts tracking imports of industrial chemicals rapidly filling the EU market\nThe Commission has started monitoring the import volumes of certain ethylene and ammonia products, which are mainly used for fertiliser production and industrial applications.\n1 min read\nSee all\nLatest events\nPartner meetings\nCivil Society Dialogue on the EU’s Trade defence instruments – Annual Report 2023\nThursday 26 September 2024, 14:30 - 16:30 (CEST)\nLive streaming available\nPartner meetings\nCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2022\nMonday 25 September 2023, 11:00 - 13:00 (CEST)\nOnline only\nLive streaming available\nPartner meetings\nCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2021\nThursday 24 November 2022, 14:00 - 16:00 (CET)\nOnline only\nLive streaming available\nSee all\nShare this page",

The normal value is either the product's price as sold on the home market of the non-EU company, or a price based on the cost of production and profit.\nLatest Official Journal publications\nInvestigating injurious dumping\nThe European Commission is responsible for investigating dumping claims and imposing measures.\nThe Commission opens an investigation if it has sufficient evidence that imports into the EU are made at dumped prices and are causing injury to European industry.\nTypically, such evidence is communicated to the Commission by the European producers  exposed to the unfair competition of dumped imports (or jointly by trade unions and European industry) by means of an official complaint.\nConditions for making a complaint\nHow to draft an anti-dumping complaint\n(available in all offiicial EU languages)\nIn special circumstances, the Commission may also initiate an investigation on its own initiative, i.e. without having received a complaint. This is commonly referred to as an ‘ex officio’ initiation.\nWhile not based on a formal complaint, an ‘ex officio’ initiation is subject to the same legal and evidential requirements as those applicable to complaints. Thus the Commission may only initiate an investigation on its own motion if it has sufficient evidence of dumped imports causing injury to European industry.\nSuch evidence is normally only available to the European producers concerned. It requires knowledge and evidence that imports of a specific product would be dumped and, more critically, access to detailed business proprietary data relating to the performance of an industry at the level of that specific product.\nTherefore ‘ex officio’ investigations are in practice limited to circumstances where the parameters of a case (e.g. definition of the product scope and the relevant information on the situation faced by the affected European producers) are already established.\nA typical example is the initiation of anti-circumvention investigations. Via its monitoring of existing measures, the Commission may become aware of practices that result in the evasion of anti-dumping measures. In such circumstances, the Commission initiates ‘ex officio’ anti-circumvention investigations without awaiting a formal request from the European producers concerned.\nShould you wish to know more about this topic, you may\ncontact the European Commission's anti-dumping service\n.\nThe anti-dumping investigation\nThe Commission opens an anti-dumping proceeding (investigation) by publishing a notice in the\nEU's Official Journal\n.\nThe investigation checks:\nwhether there is dumping by the producers in the country/countries concerned;\nwhether the European industry concerned suffers 'material injury';\nwhether there is a causal link between dumping and injury, and;\nwhether putting measures in place is not against the European interest.\nOnly when all four conditions are met can the Commission put anti-dumping measures in place.\nThe time limit for the Commission's investigation is 14 months. The results are then published in the Official Journal.\nThe full conditions\nfor putting an anti-dumping measure in place.\nMain stages of an anti-dumping investigation\nFlowchart of a typical anti-dumping investigation\nAlternative dumping calculation methodology\nSince December 2017, the EU has an alternative method to calculate dumped imports if state interference significantly distorts the economy of the exporting country.\nIn this case, the Commission will use undistorted benchmarks to determine the 'normal value' of the product. This can apply to all WTO Members where significant market distortions are found.\nCommission memo\non how it calculates state-distorted dumping\nTo show that distortions exist, the Commission examines all evidence in any case, including that contained in country-specific reports.\nCountry report on China\nCountry report on Russia\nAnti-dumping measures\nAnti-dumping measures can be put on imports of specific products if the Commission's anti-dumping investigation justifies it.\nThese measures are usually in the form of an 'ad valorem' duty. Other measures that can be applied include a fixed or specific amount of duty or, in some cases, a minimum import price.\nPrice undertakings may also be accepted instead of anti-dumping duties. This is where the exporter agrees not sell products in the EU at prices below a minimum amount.\nIf the Commission agrees to an undertaking, then the anti-dumping duties will not be collected on those imports. The Commission is not obliged to accept an offer of an undertaking.\nThe importer in the EU pays the duties and the national customs authority of the EU country collects them. The Commission monitors measures to make sure they are effective and respected by exporters and importers.\nTypes of trade defence measure\nThe way forward on anti-dumping\nAn anti-dumping investigation can be initiated in response to a complaint lodged by European manufacturers affected by dumped imports or at the request of an EU country.\nEU producers that are considering lodging an anti-dumping complaint should\ncontact us\n.\nReviewing anti-dumping measures\nMeasures are generally in place for five years and may be reviewed if, for example:\nthe circumstances of the exporters have changed, or;\na new non-EU company starts exporting to the EU and requests the calculation of its own dumping margin.\nMeasures end after five years unless the Commission does an expiry review.\nHow to ask for a review\nRefunding anti-dumping duties\nImporters may request a full or partial refund of duties paid when they can show that they have paid duties in excess of the actual dumping margin prevailing for their non EU-supplier.\nHow to apply for a refund\nMore information\nThe EU's\nbasic Anti-dumping Regulation\n2017 amendment\nCodified basic anti-dumping regulation\nThis regulation meets the rules in the\nWTO Anti-Dumping Agreement\n.\nAnnual Reports on EU trade defence actions\nTrade defence contacts\nLatest news\nNews article\n11 April 2025\nEU takes action against dumped imports of food flavour enhancer\nThe European Commission has extended its anti-dumping measures on imports of monosodium glutamate (MSG) from China, to cover imports from Malaysia.\n1 min read\nNews article\n25 March 2025\nCommission strengthens protection for EU steel industry\nThe European Commission has tightened the steel safeguard measure to shield the EU steel industry from surging imports, delivering on the EU's Steel and Metals Action Plan.\n1 min read\nNews article\n24 March 2025\nCommission starts tracking imports of industrial chemicals rapidly filling the EU market\nThe Commission has started monitoring the import volumes of certain ethylene and ammonia products, which are mainly used for fertiliser production and industrial applications.\n1 min read\nSee all\nLatest events\nPartner meetings\nCivil Society Dialogue on the EU’s Trade defence instruments – Annual Report 2023\nThursday 26 September 2024, 14:30 - 16:30 (CEST)\nLive streaming available\nPartner meetings\nCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2022\nMonday 25 September 2023, 11:00 - 13:00 (CEST)\nOnline only\nLive streaming available\nPartner meetings\nCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2021\nThursday 24 November 2022, 14:00 - 16:00 (CET)\nOnline only\nLive streaming available\nSee all\nShare this page",

A complaint must be supported by a major proportion of EU production. Collectively, these companies must account for at least 25% of total EU production of the product concerned. In general complainants would contact the producers in other EU countries to seek support before filing a complaint. Even if the complainants account for more than 25% of total EU production, their complaint would not be admissible if it were expressly opposed by EU producers accounting for a larger production volume.\nAny product can be the subject of a complaint, but the anti-subsidy rules do not apply to services.\nSubsidised products may originate in any non-EU country except Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.\n(Anti-subsidy rules do not apply to these countries for most products, because they belong to the European Economic Area and have adopted EU legislation in most areas, making them part of the EU single market.)\nIf exports from several countries are being subsidised, all of the countries concerned should be examined in the complaint.\nConfidentiality\nInformation can be provided on a confidential basis, in which case it will not be revealed without the permission of the party that supplied it.\nHowever, a non-confidential version of the complaint must also be delivered, so that it can be distributed to interested parties. This is to ensure that all parties to an investigation have the opportunity to defend their rights.\nThe investigation\nIf a complaint is accepted, the Commission must initiate an investigation within 45 days of the complaint being formally lodged.

The deadline for replies to the questionnaire is specified in the Notice of Initiation.\nParties who do not reply to the questionnaire are considered to be not cooperating with the investigation. The Commission will continue the investigation and may use other information available. The duty imposed on a non- cooperating exporter is likely to be higher than if it had cooperated.\nThe data submitted in response to the questionnaires is verified by case handlers. This is usually done by inspecting the respondent's records at the company premises.\nThe Commission then makes provisional findings. At this point it may:\nimpose provisional countervailing duties (usually in force for four months);\ncontinue the investigation without imposing duties, or;\nterminate the investigation.\nAll interested parties receive a disclosure document explaining the essential considerations on which the Commission's provisional findings were based, and are invited to comment.\nThe Commission then continues its investigation, taking due account of the comments received.\nWhen the Commission makes its final findings, it sends another disclosure document to interested parties. Based on its final findings, the Commission either:\nimposes definitive measures, or;\nterminates the case without measures.\nThe Commission must impose any measures within 13 months of the initiation of the investigation. The Commission is responsible for all investigations in this area. It has also become the only decision-making body. However, the Member States retained power to block the Commission's proposals when it comes to the most important decisions, such as imposition of definitive duties. However, to do so they will need to achieve a qualified majority of votes against the proposal.\nIs it necessary to employ a lawyer?\nThere is no obligation to employ a lawyer. A company may defend its own interests during an investigation.\nThe Commission is available to answer queries from interested parties throughout the investigation. Case officers' contact details are provided to the parties to an investigation.\nTune in to trade policy insights\n19 December 2024\nEpisode 10\nTom Moylan meets the new Trade and Economic Security Commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, to discuss Mercosur, tariffs, and trust.\n19/12/2024 | Episode 10 | 29 minutes\n14 November 2024\nEpisode 9\nDo you care about where our goods come from?

        "description": "Trade topics\nAnti-subsidy\nTrade defence\nTrade policy\nInterim review\nWhat is an interim review?\nCountervailing measures are usually imposed for five years. If circumstances change, however, interested parties may ask for a review:\nEU countries and the Commission: at any time\nany exporter, importer, authorities of an exporting country or EU producer concerned: only after the measures have been in force for one year.\nAn interim review can cover subsidisation, injury and Community interest (full interim review), or be limited to just one aspect, e.g. subsidisation (partial interim review).\nInterim review procedure\nTo request an interim review, contact the Commission in writing, stating the reasons for the review and providing prima facie evidence substantiating the need for it.\nIf the Commission accepts the request, it will then publish a Notice of Initiation in the EU’s Official Journal and send out questionnaires to interested parties, just as in the original investigation. A review should be concluded within 12 months – 15 months at most.\nWhat is looked at in a review?\nThis depends on the reason for the review. Often the request concerns the level of the duty in force – an exporter or the government of the exporting country may claim that the amount of subsidy has fallen, for example, in which case the subsidy margin is recalculated for a new investigation period.\nThe Commission will also investigate whether or not the change in circumstances is lasting. If it is not, then the duty rate would not normally be changed. Similar considerations would apply if the government of the exporting country claimed that the subsidy had been abolished altogether.\nInterested parties wishing to request a review should contact us providing prima facie evidence of their claim.\nNew Exporter Review\nWhat is a new exporter review?\nAnti-subsidy measures are usually imposed for five years.\nImports from companies that cooperated with the investigation are usually liable for their own individual duty, but there is also a 'country-wide' duty for imports from all other companies producing and exporting the product concerned to the EU, which will often be higher than the individual duty.\nIf a company starts exporting the product to the EU after the investigation, then its goods will be subject to the 'country-wide' duty.\nCompanies that either did not exist, or did not export to the EU during the original investigation, can request a new exporter review to have their own individual duty rate established.\nTo qualify as a 'new exporter', a company must not have been individually investigated during the original investigation for reasons other than a refusal to cooperate.\nIf a company appears to meet this criterion, a review will be opened.\nInterested parties wishing to claim to be treated as a new exporter should contact us for more information on the procedure.\nAbsorption\nDuties are said to be absorbed when, after anti-dumping or countervailing duties have been imposed, export prices decrease or the resale prices of the imported goods do not increase sufficiently, so the measures do not have the expected effect.\nWhat is an anti-absorption re-investigation?\nWhen there is evidence of duties being absorbed, the original trade defence investigation may be re-opened at the request of any interested party (EU producer, exporter, importer, user), EU country or the Commission.\nThe re-investigation is initiated by publishing a Notice in the EU’s Official Journal, normally within two years of the original measures being imposed. It should take no more than nine months to complete.\nWhat can be done?\nThe re-investigation gives exporters, importers, EU producers and users the opportunity to explain the export prices and EU resale prices. If the conclusion is that the duties should have resulted in price changes that did not take place, the dumping margins can be recalculated and the duties increased up to double the rate of the original duty.\nWhat law is applied here?\nArticle 12 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 19(3) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation.\nHow to proceed\nAny interested party (EU industry, exporter, importer, user) which finds evidence of absorption of duties can either lodge a complaint with the European Commission (Directorate General for Trade, Directorate H) or inform national authorities, who may ask for the investigation to be reopened.\nCircumvention\nWhat is circumvention?\nIn essence, circumvention is any activity designed to avoid the payment of countervailing duties imposed on a particular product manufactured in and/or exported from a non-EU country.\nThese practices can best be understood through examples:\nslightly modifying a product so that it can be classified under a combined nomenclature (CN) code that is not subject to duties\nfalsely declaring that a product originated in a country not subject to duties\nexporting through a producer with a lower duty rate\nexporting a product in parts and having it assembled in the EU, where the parts are not subject to duties.\nFor a practice to qualify as circumvention, there must also be evidence that:\nEU industry is being harmed or the duty’s effects are being undermined in terms of prices and/or quantities of the product in question, and;\nevidence that the imported product and/or parts thereof still benefit from the subsidy.\nIf a company is circumventing the duties in force, what can be done?\nThe Commission may open an investigation if sufficient evidence of circumvention is provided by:\nan interested party, or;\nan EU country, and;\nthe Commission believes one is warranted.\nThe first step in an investigation is the publication of a Regulation in the EU’s Official Journal. Customs authorities will then begin registering all imports alleged to be circumventing the measures. This enables them to impose a duty retroactively, should circumvention be found.\nWhat is the result of the investigation?\nIf it is determined that circumvention has taken place, the duties in force will be extended to imports from the country or company found to be circumventing them. The duties then apply retroactively from the date on which the investigation began.\nWhat about exporters in the country concerned that are not circumventing the duties?\nThe Regulation opening the investigation clearly states that companies not engaging in circumvention must contact the Commission by a specific deadline and provide information and evidence proving that they are not related to any producer subject to measures, nor engaged in circumvention themselves.\nThe Commission can then propose that individual companies be exempted from registration of their imports and/or the extension of duties. When circumvention takes place in the EU, exemptions may be also granted to importers.\nExpiry review\nWhat is an expiry review?\nCountervailing measures are normally imposed for a fixed period of five years. After that, they automatically expire unless a review demonstrates a need for them to be continued.\nAn 'expiry review' can be launched either at the request of producers in the EU, or on the initiative of the Commission. Any request for a review must be accompanied by evidence that the expiry of measures would be likely to result in a continuation or recurrence of subsidisation and injury, for example:\nevidence of continued subsidisation and injury;\nevidence that the removal of injury is only due to the measures in force, and/or;\nevidence that further subsidisation and injury is likely if the measures are repealed.\nWhat is the procedure?\nIn the final year of the measures, the Commission publishes a Notice of Impending Expiry in the EU’s Official Journal. Community producers may then request a review no later than three months before the measures are due to expire.\nIf no review request is received, the Commission publishes a Notice of Expiry announcing that the measures will lapse at the end of the five-year period.\nIf it receives a substantiated request for review, the Commission publishes a Notice of Initiation of an expiry review and starts an investigation to examine both subsidisation and injury. An expiry review should normally be completed within 12 months – 15 months at most.\nFollowing an expiry review, the duties are either repealed or maintained – in which case they will normally remain in force for a further five years. An expiry review cannot lead to a change in the level or form of duty – this can be accomplished only through an interim review.\nChanges of name, address or legal status for companies subject to an individual duty\nCompanies subject to an individual duty and mentioned by name in the operative part of an anti-dumping regulation and that change their name and/or address should contact us immediately.\nIf the name and address details in the regulation imposing the measures are not identical to the name and address on the export documents, difficulties may arise with customs formalities. The Commission will verify the data and inform the company if it needs more information. Details of the new name/address will be published in the EU’s Official Journal.\nCompanies undergoing a more complex structural change such as a merger or takeover should also contact us to determine whether the changes require a change of name or a partial interim review.\nTune in to trade policy insights\n19 December 2024\nEpisode 10\nTom Moylan meets the new Trade and Economic Security Commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, to discuss Mercosur, tariffs, and trust.\n19/12/2024 | Episode 10 | 29 minutes\n14 November 2024\nEpisode 9\nDo you care about where our goods come from?

        "description": "Trade topics\nAnti-subsidy\nA subsidy is a financial contribution made by (or on behalf of) a government or a public body that gives the recipient a benefit.\nSome subsidies are used to pursue domestic or social policies, for example supporting industries that help create new jobs. However, unfair subsidies can distort the EU market, create unfair competition and therefore damage European industry.\nThe EU can impose duties to counteract a subsidy, but only if it is limited to a specific firm, industry, or group of firms or industries. Export subsidies, and subsidies based on using domestic goods over imported ones, are specific.\nEU anti-subsidy rules\nDatabase of all subsidies investigated by the EU in its anti-subsidy investigations\nThis document is for information purposes only and is no way binding on the Commission and the European Union. Only the text of the relevant Regulations as published in the Official Journal of the European Union is authentic and legally binding.\nLatest Official Journal publications\nTypes of subsidy\nThe recipient benefits when financial contributions are provided on more favourable terms than those available on the market.\nA financial contribution can be:\na direct or potential transfer of funds (e.g. grants, loans, equity injection or loan guarantees);\ngovernment revenue abandoned or not collected (e.g. tax credits);\na government providing goods and services, apart from infrastructure;\na government purchasing goods and;\nany of the above done by a private company on the instruction of the government.\nA specific subsidy is limited to a particular sector (e.g. ceramics or chemicals). A subsidy that is broadly available, like helping small businesses regardless of the industrial sector, is not considered specific.\nThe EU's anti-subsidy investigation\nWhen an EU industry thinks that imports of a product from a non-EU country are subsidised and injuring the EU industry producing the same product, it can lodge a complaint with the Commission.\nOverview on lodging a complaint\nIf the complaint shows evidence of subsidy and injury, the Commission must open an anti-subsidy investigation.\nIn special circumstances, the Commission may also initiate an investigation on its own initiative, i.e. without having received a complaint. This is commonly referred to as an ‘ex officio’ initiation.\nWhile not based on a formal complaint, an ‘ex officio’ initiation is subject to the same legal and evidential requirements as those applicable to complaints. Thus the Commission may only initiate an investigation on its own motion if it has sufficient evidence of subsidised imports causing injury to European industry.\nSuch evidence is normally only available to the European producers concerned. It requires knowledge and evidence that imports of a specific product would be subsidised and, more critically, access to detailed business proprietary data relating to the performance of an industry at the level of that specific product.\nTherefore ‘ex officio’ investigations are in practice limited to circumstances where the parameters of a case (e.g. definition of the product scope and the relevant information on the situation faced by the affected European producers) are already established.\nA typical example is the initiation of anti-circumvention investigations. Via its monitoring of existing measures, the Commission may become aware of practices that result in the evasion of anti-subsidy measures. In such circumstances, the Commission initiates ‘ex officio’ anti-circumvention investigations without awaiting a formal request from the European producers concerned.\nThe investigation checks if:\nthe imports benefit from countervailable subsidies, including those identified in the complaint or discovered in the course of the investigation;\nthe EU industry suffers material injury;\nthere is a causal link between the injury and the subsidised imports, and;\nputting measures in place is in the European interest.\nDetails of the anti-subsidy investigation procedure\nFlowchart of the anti-subsidy investigation process\nTypes of countervailing measures\nCountervailing measures counteract the effects of subsidised imports on the EU market and restore fair competition. The measures can be:\nadding a percentage of the price to the goods;\na fixed amount per unit;\napplying a minimum import price, or;\na 'price undertaking', where the exporter commits to sell the product under investigation above a minimum price. In return, the Commission doesn't impose a duty.\nThe Commission monitors import volumes and prices of all products subject to measures, to make sure the countervailing measures are working. It does so in close cooperation with:\nthe customs authorities of EU countries\n;\nthe Commission tax and customs department\n, and;\nthe European fraud prevention agency (OLAF)\n.\nThe exporting country may also agree to remove or limit the unfair subsidy.\nInterim and expiry reviews\nCountervailing measures lapse after five years. In that period, the Commission can conduct an interim review.\nAn interim review shall be initiated where the request contains sufficient evidence that the continued imposition of the measure is no longer necessary to offset the countervailable subsidy and/or that the injury would be unlikely to continue or recur if the measure were removed or varied, or that the existing measure is not, or is no longer, sufficient to counteract the countervailable subsidy which is causing injury.\nHow to ask for an interim review\nIn the final year of measures, the EU producers may ask the Commission to conduct an expiry review. This review determines whether the expiry of the measures could lead to continued or recurring subsidisation and injury. If so, the measures may continue for another five years.\nHow to request an expiry review\nImporters can also request a refund of the duties paid when they think that the amount of subsidy has been reduced or eliminated.\nHow to ask for a refund\nMore on Anti-subsidy\nRegulation (EU) 2016/1037 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Union\n2017 amendment\nCodified basic anti-subsidy regulation\nCommission Notice concerning the reimbursement of anti-dumping duties (2014/C 164/09)\nThe EU's\nanti-subsidy rules\nare based on a 1994 WTO agreement which allows remedial action to be taken against subsidies that are considered an unfair trade practice.\nThe Commission has also adopted\nguidelines for calculating the amount of a subsidy\n.\nLatest news\nNews article\n24 January 2025\nEU extends duties on electric bicycles from China\nThe European Commission has published two Regulations extending anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of electric bicycles (e-bikes) from China for another five years.\n1 min read\nStatement\n8 November 2024\nDiscussions on undertakings for electric vehicles in Beijing\nDiscussions between the EU and China on a possible agreement on price undertakings for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) took place in Beijing this week.\n1 min read\nPress release\n29 October 2024\nEU imposes duties on unfairly subsidised electric vehicles from China while discussions on price undertakings continue\nToday the European Commission concluded its anti-subsidy investigation by imposing definitive countervailing duties on imports of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) from China for a period of five years.\nSee all\nLatest events\nPartner meetings\nCivil Society Dialogue on the EU’s Trade defence instruments – Annual Report 2023\nThursday 26 September 2024, 14:30 - 16:30 (CEST)\nLive streaming available\nSee all\nShare this page",

        "description": "Trade topics\nDigital trade\nDigital technologies increasingly enable trade. For example:\nbanks rely heavily on the international transfer of data;\nagricultural commodity traders use e-signatures to conclude international purchases;\nmanufacturers, freight operators and logistics enterprises can track and improve the performance of their machines and vehicles around the world thanks to electronic data transfers, and;\neveryday items increasingly combine sensors and internet-enabled applications, large datasets, and high-performance computing capabilities (‘Internet of Things’).\nThe global e-commerce market is growing at a dynamic rate. In 2018,\nglobal e-commerce sales\nwere estimated at more than €21 trillion, with around 1.5 billion people shopping online.\nDigital trade in the EU’s trade strategy\nThe growing importance of digital trade is reflected in the EU’s trade policy communication,\nAn Open, Sustainable and Assertive Trade Policy\n, published in 2021.\nThe communication provides that, “trade policy will play a vital role in attaining the EU’s objectives linked to the digital transition. European businesses rely on digital services, and this will only increase”.\nAgainst this backdrop, the EU has set itself ambitious goals. The communication states that, “supporting Europe’s digital agenda is a priority for EU trade policy. The objective is to ensure a leading position for the EU in digital trade and in the area of technology, most importantly by promoting innovation”.\nDigital trade in bilateral trade agreements\nThe increasing importance the EU attaches to digital trade is reflected in its bilateral trade agreements. The EU’s approach to digital trade in its free trade agreements has gradually been adapted to respond to this growing strategic priority.\nModern EU trade agreements contain a self-standing chapter on digital trade. The overarching goals of this chapter are:\nto ensure predictability and legal certainty for businesses;\nto ensure a secure online environment for consumers, and;\nto remove unjustified barriers.\nThe digital trade chapter contains almost 20 binding provisions on a wide range of issues, including the following:\nbanning customs duties on electronic transmissions (this does not forbid the imposition of internal taxes);\npromoting electronic contracts, electronic authentication methods and electronic trust services (such as e-signatures, e-seals and time stamps), which are necessary for the validation of online transactions and thus constitute a key enabler for digital trade;\nensuring online consumer protection, including protection against spam;\nprohibiting unjustified government access to software source code;\nprohibiting unjustified barriers to data flows, including data localisation requirements and protecting privacy, and;\nfacilitating regulatory cooperation.\nDigital Trade Agreements\nThe EU also negotiates modern, self-standing\ndigital trade agreements\nwith key partner countries. The digital trade agreements aim to build consumer trust, ensure predictability and legal certainty for businesses, and remove and prevent the emergence of unjustified barriers to digital trade. They are also designed to help the parties to the agreements to develop and implement the policies required to address new challenges posed by the digital economy.\nThe digital trade agreements demonstrate the EU's commitment to being at the forefront of new digital developments, while upholding open digital economies that are competitive, transparent, fair, and free of unjustified barriers to international trade.\nOn 27 June 2023, the Council of the European Union authorised the Commission to open negotiations for digital trade agreements with Singapore and the Republic of Korea. These self-standing digital trade agreements should build on and complement the EU's existing trade frameworks with its partner countries.\nThe negotiations also build on the cooperation and convergence in the Digital Partnerships and Digital Trade Principles that the EU has agreed with the\nRepublic of Korea\nand\nSingapore\n. These negotiations reflect the strategic importance of digital trade and the pivotal role of the Southeast Asian region.\nThe digital trade agreements with the Republic of Korea and Singapore will put forward clear and binding rules, thereby enhancing the EU's synergies in the Indo-Pacific region: one of the most vibrant and forward-looking hubs of the digital transformation.\nThese agreements will:\nunlock new markets;\nmake electronic transactions easier;\npromote a safe online environment for consumers;\ncreate legal certainty for businesses;\nimprove access to electronic commerce, and;\nfacilitate digital trade.\nMore on digital trade agreements\nDigital Trade Principles\nThe EU has concluded Digital Partnerships with some of its partner countries to advance cooperation on several digital issues, including digital economy and trade, as well as trusted data flows and data innovation, standards, and the digital transformation of businesses and public services.\nThe Digital Partnerships pave the way for cooperation in new and emerging areas with transformative economic potential for our economies. They also enable regulatory cooperation and common positions in international forums.\nThe Digital Partnerships address digital trade and include Digital Trade Principles as an important deliverable. The Digital Trade Principles are non-binding instruments that reflect a common understanding on key issues relevant to digital trade and a joint commitment to an open digital economy, free of unjustified barriers to international trade.\nThe Digital Trade Principles cover\ndata\ngovernance (including free flow of data with trust, and open government data), digital trade facilitation (including paperless trading, single windows, electronic contracts, electronic authentication and electronic signatures, electronic invoicing), consumer trust (including online consumer protection and safety), and business trust (including open internet access, cybersecurity, and protection of source code and cryptography-related technology).\nThey also provide a forum for cooperation on unjustified barriers to digital trade.\nEU and the Republic of Korea sign Digital Trade Principles\n, on 30 November 2022 (\nfull text\n)\nEU and Singapore launch Digital Partnership\n, on 1 February 2023 (\nfull text\n)\nThe EU’s approach to ensuring free flow of data\nData is the lifeblood of the digital economy. It is therefore vital that EU companies can move their data across borders.\nWhen negotiating trade agreements, the EU proposes the straightforward prohibition of protectionist barriers to cross-border data flows. At the same time, it ensures that trade agreements cannot be used to challenge existing and future EU law on the protection of personal data and privacy, which are fundamental rights in the EU.\nThe EU’s approach to data flows is based on the premise that high standards of data protection and the facilitation of international trade can go hand–in-hand. Accordingly, the EU promotes a vision in which a high level of protection for privacy and personal data is a pre-condition for stable, secure and competitive global commercial flows in the digital world.\nThe provisions negotiated by the EU in its trade agreements reflect this balanced approach.\nDigital trade in the World Trade Organization\nMultilateral rules are needed to develop a common, coherent approach that tackles global challenges effectively, fosters new opportunities, and encourages the expansion of digital trade (or 'e-commerce' as it is historically called in the WTO).\nDuring the 11\nth\nWTO Ministerial Conference, held in Buenos Aires in December 2017, a group of WTO Members decided to explore the opportunity to negotiate WTO rules on e-commerce. After a year of exploratory talks, plurilateral WTO negotiations on e-commerce were officially launched in January 2019. 86 WTO Members, including EU Member States, are currently engaged in these negotiations.\nThe e-commerce negotiations in the WTO aim to:\nfacilitate electronic transactions (e.g. e-contracts, e-signatures, e-payments);\nenhance consumer and business trust;\naddress barriers related to cross-border data flows and data localisation requirements;\nprotect computer source code;\nfacilitate online trade in goods (e.g. paperless trade);\nimprove the regulatory conditions for telecommunications services by updating the WTO Telecommunications Reference Paper, and;\nimprove market access in services sectors and goods that are key for e-commerce.\nThe EU’s objective in the e-commerce negotiations is to reach an agreement on a comprehensive and ambitious set of WTO rules and obligations, enhancing both domestic and global e-commerce. The EU wants to facilitate business operations, especially those of SMEs, and to strengthen consumer trust in the online environment.\nThe EU also wants the negotiated outcome to be supported by as many WTO Members as possible. It is therefore adopting a flexible negotiating approach that takes into account the different opportunities and challenges that Members may face in relation to e-commerce.\nMore on e-commerce negotiations at the WTO\nMoratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions\nSince 1998, WTO Members have agreed not to impose customs duties on electronic transmissions – which range from software, emails, and text messages to digital music, movies and videogames.\nThis moratorium is renewed every two years at the WTO Ministerial Conference. The EU is in favour of permanently prohibiting customs duties on electronic transmission, including the transmitted content.\nThe EU considers that it is not in any WTO Member’s interest to retain the right to impose customs duties on electronic transmissions. Such a policy decision would discourage enterprises, and especially SMEs, from engaging in global e-commerce. Customs duties could also increase the cost of business input – and therefore result in higher prices for consumers, market distortions and trade diversion. Many WTO Members have committed in their free trade agreements to ban such customs duties permanently.\nThe EU believes that permanently prohibiting customs duties on electronic transmissions should be part of the negotiated outcome in the WTO e-commerce negotiations.\nTune in to trade policy insights\n25 February 2025\nEpisode 11\nDigital trade is crucial for global business, enabling activities like farming in the Netherlands, accounting in Arizona, and music streaming in South Korea through digital data transfers.

        "description": "Trade topics\nServices\nTrade in services covers a huge variety of sectors, including professional, financial, telecommunications, transport, postal and courier, retail and distribution, environmental, health, education, tourism, and recreational services. Trade in services is vital for the EU economy, as indicated by the following:\nThe EU is the world’s largest trader of services;\nTrade in services accounts for 25% of the EU’s GDP, with services exports exceeding €900 billion per year, and;\nTrade in services supports 21 million EU jobs, directly and indirectly.\nMore statistics on EU exports and imports of services\nWhy the EU negotiates agreements on trade in services\nRemoving unnecessary and discriminatory restrictions to the supply of services is important in order to harvest the societal and economic benefits of services. The EU has been at the forefront of negotiations to open up trade in services, both at multilateral level and in bilateral agreements.\nThe key objectives in these negotiations are to ensure that EU service providers:\nare allowed to supply services in foreign markets, and;\nare not discriminated against compared to national operators or other foreign operators.\nThe services negotiations do not seek to deregulate services. Addressing barriers to trade in services does not prevent countries from regulating the services provided to their citizens. Countries remain free to define and implement appropriate standards to protect health, safety and the environment, which apply to domestic and foreign service suppliers alike.\nTrade in services in the EU’s bilateral trade agreements\nThe EU’s trade strategy seeks to complement multilateral liberalisation efforts with deeper commitments in preferential trade agreements. In 2021, the EU applied 45 trade agreements with 77 partners.\nAll the EU’s bilateral trade agreements typically cover trade in services. Recent agreements such as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada (CETA), and the Trade and Cooperation Agreement with the United Kingdom – and ongoing negotiations such as those with Australia and New Zealand – include comprehensive and ambitious provisions on services.\nJust like at multilateral level, bilateral trade agreements do not seek to impose privatisation or deregulation, but only to progressively facilitate trade through greater openness to foreign service suppliers.\nMore information on the EU’s trade agreements\nServices in the EU’s trade strategy\nThe EU’s trade policy communication,\nAn Open, Sustainable and Assertive Trade Policy\n, adopted in February 2021, identifies six areas that are critical to achieving EU trade policy and supporting the digital transition. Trade in services is among them.\nThe communication recognises that, “the nature of trade will continue to evolve. It will become more innovation-driven, supported by intellectual property (IP) protection, with an increasing role of services trade compared to goods”.\nMore information on the EU’s trade policy communication\nTrade in services in the World Trade Organization\nAt the World Trade Organization (WTO), trade in services is primarily regulated by the General\nAgreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The GATS applies to all WTO Members, thus including the EU and its Member States.\nThe objectives of the GATS are to create a reliable and predictable system of international rules for trade in services, and to facilitate the progressive liberalisation of services markets.\nMore information on the GATS\nPlurilateral negotiations on issues relating to trade in services are currently ongoing at the WTO. These negotiations cover two areas:\nDomestic Regulation:\nMore than 60 WTO Members, including all EU Member States, are currently involved in these negotiations. Participants comprise both developed and developing countries, and cover more than 70% of global trade in services. The aim of these negotiations is to prevent the adoption of measures that constitute unnecessary barriers to trade in services, while nonetheless allowing countries to pursue national public policy objectives.\nMore information on Domestic Regulation negotiations at the WTO\nE-commerce:\n86 WTO Members, including all EU Member States, are currently engaged in these negotiations. The potential economic value of the negotiations is significant, as WTO commitments are negotiated in what is perhaps the most dynamic and strategic area of modern trade. The scope of the negotiations includes over 40 issues, which cover a wide range of trade-related aspects of e-commerce, such as facilitating electronic transactions (e.g. e-contracts, e-signatures, e-payments); enhancing consumer and business trust; facilitating online trade in goods; etc.\nMore information on e-commerce negotiations at the WTO\nLatest news\nPress release\n27 February 2024\nNew global rules to simplify trade in services enter into force in the WTO\nTrade in services just got a boost with the entry into force of new World Trade Organization (WTO) rules facilitating and simplifying trade in services.

        "description": "Trade topics\nGoods\nServices\nWhen is a product a good or a service?\nThe link between goods and services is increasing, as access to services becomes more of a prerequisite for the strong economic performance of many manufactured products.\nTrade in services covers a wide variety of sectors, such as transport, telecommunications, professional services, financial services, postal and courier services, retail and distribution, environmental services and tourism services. EU trade agreements typically cover trade in services. The EU's objective is to ensure that EU service providers are allowed to supply services in foreign markets and are not discriminated against vis-à-vis national operators or other foreign operators in the same sector.\nProducers and exporters of goods such as textiles, cars or computers, for example, cannot be competitive without access to efficient banking, insurance or accountancy – or to telecommunications and transport systems. The purchase of many products often involves a service component.\nCloud computing allows services such as technical infrastructure, platforms and software to be provided on a global basis. Instead of installing hardware at their customers’ premises, service providers can now offer their services from the cloud remotely – and across borders – demonstrating how services can substitute goods in certain cases.\nMore on\ntrade in services\nand\ndigital trade\nGuide for businesses on trading in services\nWhy is it relevant?\nThe EU is the world's biggest exporter of manufactured goods, and is a global market leader for high-quality products.\nThe EU economy is already one of the world’s most open to trade: EU import tariffs for industrial products are among the lowest in the world.\nImports from many suppliers of industrial products to the EU enter the bloc at reduced rates under the terms of\nbilateral agreements\nor other import duty suspensions, like the\nGeneralised Scheme of Preferences\n.\nThe services sector contributes more to economic growth and job creation in the EU than any other sector. Services represent some three quarters of the EU’s gross domestic product and two thirds of its employment. The EU is also the world’s biggest exporter of services.\nServices account for over 80% of the EU’s inward foreign direct investment, and for more than 60% of its outward foreign direct investment.\nMutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs)\nfacilitate market access by reducing costs and time associated with mandatory product certification.\nThe significance of non-tariff barriers to trade, such as\ntechnical barriers to trade\nor\nsanitary and phytosanitary measures\n,\nhas increased considerably, as tariffs steadily decline and governments worldwide introduce more regulatory requirements to address\ninter alia\nhealth, safety or environmental concerns.\nThe way a product is treated on import is linked to its country of origin\n. Yet globalisation means that many different countries are involved in manufacturing. Determining where goods come from requires clear\nrules of origin\n.\nEU trade policy on goods and services\nThe EU wants to free up global trade in goods and services through\nWTO negotiations\nand through\nbilateral and regional trade agreements\n.\nMultilateral and plurilateral negotiations on goods and services:\nCertain WTO members including the EU have joined the\nInformation Technology Agreement\n(ITA) which provides duty-free access to IT products, including computers, telephones and inputs and components such as semiconductors.\nThe ITA has helped to quadruple trade in information technology products.\nSince the ITA was signed in 1996, many products have become obsolete, while new products have emerged. Entire sectors have become digitised, such as medical devices and other sophisticated instruments.\nMore information on the ITA and its update\nOn services, the EU is currently participating in two WTO plurilateral negotiations regarding e-commerce and domestic regulation.\nE-commerce: Digital technologies have transformed international trade and strongly influence trade policymaking. The EU proposed ambitious digital trade rules in the ongoing plurilateral negotiations on e-commerce in the WTO, which engage more than half of the WTO’s membership. These negotiations remain the EU’s most important strategic objective in the area of digital trade. More information on\ne-commerce at the WTO\n.\nDomestic regulation: Barriers to trade in services often take the form of ‘behind the border’ obstacles created through domestic regulatory regimes. The EU is in a group of over 60 WTO members committed to developing disciplines to mitigate the unintended trade-restrictive effects of measures relating to licensing requirements and procedures, qualification requirements and procedures, and technical standards. More information on\ndomestic regulation at the WTO\n.\nBilateral negotiations on goods and services\nA number of the EU's bilateral trade agreements have significantly liberalised trade in goods. Some also include provisions covering non-tariff barriers and trade in services. For example:\nThe EU and\nMexico\n's Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement opens up trade in both goods and services.\nThe Association Agreement between the EU and\nChile\ncreates a free trade area in goods and services.\nThe EU-\nSouth Korea\nFree Trade Agreement eliminates tariffs. The agreement only excludes a limited number of agricultural products from tariff elimination. It also breaks new ground in addressing non-tariff barriers to trade.\nThe EU's trade agreement with\nPeru and Colombia\nopens up goods and services markets on both sides.\nThe Association Agreement between the EU and\nCentral America\nimproves access to goods and services markets, and improves conditions for trade through new disciplines on non-tariff barriers.\nThe EU-\nSingapore\nFree Trade Agreement includes substantial commitments on trade in services, creating opportunities for investment in many service sectors. The deal facilitates access of industrial and agricultural products to this important export market and trade hub in Southeast Asia, through greater recognition of EU standards.\nThe way forward on goods and services\nThe EU continues to negotiate ambitious provisions to improve access to goods and services markets with several regions and countries including:\nMercosur\nGulf Cooperation Council\nCanada\nIndia\nMorocco\nUkraine\nMoldova\nGeorgia\nArmenia\nMalaysia\nIndonesia\nThe EU also concludes Economic Partnership Agreements with\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries\n.\nMore on goods and services\nThe\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\nis a WTO Agreement that reduces import tariffs on trade in goods around the world.\nThe WTO's\nGeneral Agreement on Trade in Services\naims at ensuring increased transparency and predictability of relevant rules and regulations, and promoting progressive liberalisation of international trade in services through successive rounds of negotiation.\nMutual Recognition Agreements newsletters\nLatest news\nPress release\n27 February 2024\nNew global rules to simplify trade in services enter into force in the WTO\nTrade in services just got a boost with the entry into force of new World Trade Organization (WTO) rules facilitating and simplifying trade in services.

        "description": "Trade topics\nInvestment\nThere are two main types of foreign investment:\nforeign direct investment (FDI) – where an investor sets up or buys a company (or a controlling share in a company) in another country, and;\nportfolio investment – where an investor buys shares in, or debt of, a foreign company without controlling that company.\nThe EU is the world’s main provider and the top global destination of foreign investment. Existing foreign direct investment stocks held in the rest of the world by investors resident in the EU (outbound investments) amounted to €9,382 billion at the end of 2022. Meanwhile, foreign direct investment stocks held by third country investors in the EU amounted to €7,715 billion at the end of 2022.\nBy contributing to economic growth, job creation and integration in global value chains, foreign investment tends to benefit host countries as well as home countries. Through domestic policies and international agreements, most countries seek to improve conditions to attract investors.\nFindings by the World Bank\nalso highlight the importance of helping investors retain and expand their existing investments.\nObjectives of EU investment policy\nThe EU is one of the most open places to invest in the world. Since 2009 the EU handles foreign direct investment policies on behalf of EU members, as part of the EU common commercial policy. EU investment policy aims to:\nsecure a level playing field so that EU investors abroad are not discriminated or mistreated;\nmake it easier to invest by creating a predictable and transparent business environment;\nencourage investment that supports\nsustainable development\n, respect for human rights and high labour and environmental standards - this includes promoting corporate social responsibility and responsible business practices;\nattract international investment into the EU, while protecting the EU’s essential interests, and;\npreserve the right of home and host countries to regulate their economies in the public interest.\nEU investment negotiations\nThe EU is\nnegotiating or implementing\ninvestment rules in trade agreements or in self-standing investment agreements. These investment rules cover:\nallowing the setting up of enterprises by making sure investors can access the market and do not face discrimination between EU and non-EU investors;\ncreating a favourable regulatory framework, both when the investor enters the market and when the investor does economic activities in the country, and;\nprotecting established investments/investors through commitments to non-discrimination, fair treatment for investors or guarantees of compensation in case of expropriation.\nInvestment facilitation\nThrough investment facilitation, the EU seeks to encourage the setting up of a more transparent, efficient and predictable business climate for investors. This includes, for instance, making information on investment rules public and easily available, or reducing delays in obtaining government permits and approvals.\nInvestment facilitation contributes to unlocking investment opportunities notably for small and medium enterprises. This should also benefit developing countries by making it easier for domestic and foreign investors to invest, conduct their day-to-day business, and expand their existing investments.\nIn the WTO, the EU is contributing to the discussions on investment facilitation.\nEU proposal – WTO investment facilitation for development\nIn its\nTrade Policy Review\n, the European Commission announced its intention to pursue sustainable investment agreements with Africa and the Southern Neighbourhood, focusing on investment facilitation. This initiative is being developed in negotiations for a Sustainable Investment Facilitation Agreement with\nAngola\n, and the EPA deepening negotiations with five countries of\nEastern and Southern Africa\n.\nEU reforms on investment dispute resolution\nThe EU agreed in November 2015 on a\nreformed investment dispute settlement approach\nto stay up-to-date with the highest standards of legitimacy and transparency. This introduced clearer and more precise rules on investment protection by creating a permanent dispute settlement mechanism called the Investment Court System.\nThis system makes sure that everyone follows the same investment protection rules, and seeks to strike a balance between protecting investors in a transparent manner and safeguarding a state’s right to regulate to pursue public policy objectives.\nThe European Commission promotes further reform of dispute settlement and is leading efforts with trade partners to set up a\nmultilateral investment court\nto rule on investment disputes.\nScreening framework for foreign direct investment\nOn 19 March 2019, the EU adopted a\nregulation\nto create a system to cooperate and exchange information on investments from non-EU countries that may affect security or public order. The regulation makes sure that the EU is better equipped to protect its interests, while remaining among the world’s most open investment areas.\nMore on investment screening\nInvestment agreements between EU Member States and non-EU countries\nThe EU adopted in 2012 a\nregulation\nestablishing transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between individual EU Member States and non-EU countries, to make sure that those agreements do not conflict with the EU competences and are consistent with the EU’s investment policy. On 6 April 2020, the Commission submitted\na report on the application of the regulation\n.\nThe regulation allows EU Member States to maintain\nbilateral investment agreements\nsigned before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, and sets the conditions for EU Member States to modify those agreements, and to negotiate or conclude new ones. Those conditions are:\nthat the agreement is not in conflict with EU law;\nthat the agreement is consistent with the EU’s principles and objectives for external action;\nthat the Commission did not submit (or decide to submit) a recommendation to open EU-wide negotiations with the same third country, and;\nthat the agreement does not create a serious obstacle to the EU negotiating or concluding bilateral investment agreements with non-EU countries.\nDrawing on the EU's approach to investment protection agreements – and on Member States' best practices – the Commssion has developed\nModel Clauses\nto guide Member States in their negotiation (or re-negotiation) of bilateral investment agreements.\nFrom March 2020, the Commission\npublishes its implementing decisions\non authorisations granted to individual EU members for bilateral investment agreements.\nMonitoring and assessment of risks from outbound investments\nConcern is growing regarding foreign direct investments from the EU into third countries (outbound investments). Some investments in a narrow set of critical technologies can come with the risk of EU technology and know-how getting into the hands of non-EU actors, who may use it to undermine international peace and security. This especially concerns technologies suitable for enhancing military and intelligence capabilities. The Commission is taking this reflection further with a\nWhite Paper\n, proposing an in-depth analysis of outbound investments in a narrow set of critical technologies to determine the nature and extent of risks related to such investments and the need for policy responses.\nOn 15 January 2025\n, the Commission adopted a\nrecommendation\nto Member States on reviewing outbound investments in technology areas critical for the economic security of the EU. The recommendation builds on the European Economic Security Strategy from June 2023 and the White Paper on Outbound investments from January 2024. It invites Member States to review outbound investments in third countries in semiconductors, artificial intelligence and quantum technologies and to assess, together with the Commission, any potential risks and security concerns related to these investments.\nEU participation in international fora\nThe EU participates in international institutions and organisations where rules on international investment are discussed:\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(OECD):\nInvestment Committee\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD):\nWorld Investment Forum\nWorld Trade Organization\n(WTO): Committee on\nTrade-Related Investment Measures\n(TRIMs), Structured discussions on\ninvestment facilitation for development\nUnited Nations Commission on International Trade Law\n(UNCITRAL):\nWorking Group III\non Investor-State Dispute Settlement Reform\nInternational Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes\n(ICSID)\nEnergy Charter\nLatest news\nPress release\n15 January 2025\nCommission calls on Member States to review outbound investments and assess risks to economic security\nThe Commission has today published a Recommendation calling on EU Member States to review outbound investments of their companies into non-EU countries.

These new rules reduce red tape and make it easier for smaller companies to do business with public authorities.\nOpening public procurement markets can be beneficial for many reasons:\nCompetition between private companies increases a government's chances of getting better value for money and makes the use of public resources more efficient.\nMaking the application process more transparent helps to fight corrupt practices.\nIt increases legal certainty.\nThe EU public procurement market is one of the most open in the world. However, European businesses cannot always get equal access to public procurement markets outside the EU. Many countries are reluctant to open their public procurement markets to international competition. This creates an uneven playing field for EU companies and limits business opportunities in these markets.\nSome countries have introduced protectionist measures relating to procurement contracts, which hit EU companies. Such policies are applied by:\nBrazil;\nChina;\nIndia;\nIndonesia\nRussia;\nTurkey, and;\nthe United States (among others).\nEU trade policy and public procurement\nAlongside regulating the EU's internal public procurement market, the EU also wants to see more open public procurement markets outside the EU.\nIn its trade deals, the EU and its trading partners offer each other access to procurement by certain public authorities and bodies for certain goods and services to encourage more open and balanced international markets. This means that EU companies can do business in the international public procurement market more easily, thus growing their business and providing more jobs.\nTrade talks with other countries and regions:\nRules about public procurement have already been included in EU free trade agreements (FTAs) with:\nAndean Community\nArmenia\nCanada\nCentral America\nChile\nGeorgia\nIraq\nKazakhstan\n, see also\nCentral Asia\nKyrgyzstan, see\nCentral Asia\nMercosur\nMexico\nMoldova\nSingapore\nSouth Korea\nSwitzerland\nUkraine\nVietnam\nNegotiations are ongoing with several regions and countries and are expected to open public procurement markets:\nAustralia\nAzerbaijan\nIndonesia\nNew Zealand\nTunisia\nUzbekistan, see\nCentral Asia\nThe International Procurement Instrument\nThe\nRegulation for an International Procurement Instrument\n(IPI) to improve reciprocal access to international procurement markets was published on 30 June 2022 and entered into force on 29 August 2022. The IPI gives the EU greater leverage to get access to public procurement markets outside the EU, boosting opportunities for EU companies.\nThe EU public procurement market is one of the largest and most accessible in the world. However, many of the EU's major trading partners apply restrictive practices in their markets that discriminate against EU businesses. These restrictions affect competitive EU sectors such as construction, public transport, medical devices, power generation and pharmaceuticals. The IPI will help address such procurement barriers abroad by empowering the EU to:\ninitiate investigations against alleged restrictions in third-country procurement markets;\nengage in consultations with the country concerned on the opening of its procurement market, and;\nif consultations fail to provide a satisfactory outcome, restrict access to the EU procurement market for foreign companies originating in the countries that continue to apply restrictions against EU companies.\nMore information on IPI\nHow to lodge a complaint\nIPI investigations\nGreen public procurement\nWith green public procurement, public authorities seek to procure goods, services and works that have a reduced impact on the environment throughout the lifecycle of these goods, services and works.\nThe EU and the United States have issued a\nJoint EU-US Catalogue of Best Practices on Green Public Procurement\n. The Joint EU-US Catalogue presents the policies, practices and actions used in all stages of the procurement process, from strategic planning and pre-procurement to procurement and the post-contract award stage. It addresses environmental and climate challenges, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy efficiency, or promoting circular economy approaches. It serves as inspiration for policymakers and suppliers globally, and provides ideas for the uptake of green solutions in public procurement worldwide.\nRevision of global trade rules\nThe revision of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) entered into force in 2014. It provides a higher level of clarity and transparency and guarantees equal footing to suppliers, supplies and services originating in GPA Parties in procurement procedures. It also offered some €80-100 billion a year of additional business opportunities by further opening up public procurement markets in the 48 countries that are part of the agreement.\nThere are currently 21 WTO Members that are Parties to the GPA, including the European Union and its member states counting as one Party.\nMore on public procurement\nRegulation on access to international public procurement markets\nThe International Procurement Instrument (IPI): Promoting a level playing field around the world\n(31 March 2023)\nWTO Government Procurement Agreement\nLatest news\nPress release\n14 January 2025\nCommission to assess next steps for tackling discrimination in China's public procurement market for medical devices\nA report published today, highlighting continued discrimination against EU medical devices in China's public procurement market, will inform the Commission's assessment on what measures should be taken to restore the EU-China level playing field in this area.\n1 min read\nNews article\n20 June 2024\nCommission launches new public procurement portal\nThe new tool serves as a public procurement knowledge hub, with easy-to-access information on the rules governing public procurement for contracting entities in EU Member States.\n1 min read\nPress release\n24 April 2024\nCommission launches first investigation under EU International Procurement Instrument\nToday, the European Commission has initiated for the first time an investigation under the International Procurement Instrument (IPI).\n1 min read\nSee all\nLatest events\nPartner meetings\nCivil Society Dialogue on the International Procurement Instrument\nTuesday 27 February 2024, 14:30 - 16:30 (CET)\nOnline only\nLive streaming available\nSee all\nShare this page",

        "description": "Minerals Security Partnership Forum\nTrade topics\nSustainable development\nTrade policy\nThe Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) Forum is a multilateral cooperation platform bringing together 15 MSP Partners and another 15 critical mineral-producing and -consuming countries at various stages of development, with a focus on both advancing and accelerating individual projects and promoting policies that contribute to responsible, diverse, and resilient value chains with local value-addition at the centre.\nThe MSP Forum is co-chaired by the United States and the European Union.\nThe MSP Forum was inaugurated on 5 April 2024 in Leuven, Belgium, by European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis and by US Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken. It currently has 30 members: Argentina, Australia, Canada, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, the European Union, Finland, France, Germany, Greenland, India, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Norway, Namibia, Peru, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Serbia, Sweden, Türkiye, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, and Zambia.\nThe MSP Forum has two main components:\nA project group that focuses on supporting and accelerating individual critical mineral projects, and;\na policy dialogue group addressing key policy issues linked to the secure and sustainable supply of critical minerals.\nSince its launch, two high-level events have taken place within its framework.\nThe MSP, the MSP Forum and the CRM Club\nThe MSP Forum is a key component of the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), which was launched in June 2022 on the margins of the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) Convention. While the MSP seeks to prompt public and private investments in responsible critical minerals supply chains across the world, the MSP Forum aims to formalise and extend the MSP’s existing engagements with producing countries. The 15 partners that adhered to the MSP before the MSP Forum’s launch are also members of the latter. These partners are Australia, Canada, Estonia, the European Union, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, the Republic of Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nThe MSP Forum also materialises and expands the concept of CRM Club (Critical Raw Materials Club) outlined by the European Commission in its 2023\nCommunication\non 'A secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials in support of the twin transition'.\nMSP Forum high-level events\nThe first high-level MSP Forum event was organised virtually on 18 July 2024. The main objectives and a roadmap for the MSP Forum were shared during the event. Eight new MSP Forum members were welcomed, namely Argentina, Greenland, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Namibia, Peru, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.\nThe second high-level MSP Forum event, and the first to be organised in person, took place on September 27\nth\n, 2024, in New York City, on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly High-Level Week and Climate Week. This event dealt mainly with the opportunities, priorities and challenges in responsible mining, processing and recycling of critical minerals needed for the energy transition. Seven new countries joined the forum on this occasion, i.e. the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, the Philippines, Serbia, Türkiye and Zambia.\nMSP Forum Project Group\nThe MSP Forum's Project Group focuses on supporting and accelerating critical mineral projects, by providing MSP Forum Members with the opportunity to engage with each other and with third stakeholders, including export credit agencies, development finance institutions, and the private sector, on concrete initiatives. Possible forms of engagement could include project information sharing, presentations on critical minerals opportunities within MSP Forum Members’ territories, technical assistance, and geological survey and mapping requests.\nThe MSP Forum Policy Dialogue Group\nThe Policy Dialogue Group seeks to encourage discussions between MSP Forum Members on policies aiming at supporting a secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials. It is planned to organise a series of workshops bringing together government representatives from MSP Forum Members, industry actors, non-governmental organizations, financial institutions and other key stakeholders. The discussions will focus initially on two main workstreams, the first one dealing with policies to boost public-private investments in critical minerals including a trade-friendly local-value addition agenda in producing countries, and the second one with the key opportunities and challenges arising from the application of high Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards.\nOn 12 December 2024, the EU and the United States hosted the first in a series of MSP Forum workshops, entitled 'Public-Private Investment in Critical Minerals Focusing on Developing a Positive, Trade-Friendly Local Value Addition Agenda in Producing Countries'. The workshop took place in Brussels during the 2024 edition of Raw Materials Week. Participants discussed three key issues: the challenges facing investors, government policies aimed at fostering the development of the critical raw materials sector, and ways to mobilise investment to increase local value addition.\nOn 4 February 2025, the EU and the United States hosted the second event of the Policy Dialogue Group of the MSP Forum, entitled ‘Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) Principles in Critical Minerals Supply Chains’. The event took place in Cape Town, South Africa, during the 2025 edition of Mining Indaba, and focused on the policy dimension of the implementation of ESG standards in the critical raw materials sector. Discussions dealt notably with case studies of ESG-aligned projects and policies, and with the challenges associated with the cost of products produced according to ESG standards.\nFurther information\nMinerals Security Partnership Forum:\nFactsheet\nQ&A on the Minerals Security Partnership Forum\nMSP Forum high-level meetings:\nEU and partners launch Minerals Security Partnership Forum\nStatement on the First High-Level Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) Forum Event\nEU and US welcome new members to Minerals Security Partnership\nEU and US host Minerals Security Partnership Forum workshop on critical minerals supply chains (europa.eu)\nMinerals Security Partnership:\nMinerals Security Partnership - United States Department of State\nEU Critical Raw Materials Act:\nDG GROW webpage on the Critical Raw Materials Act\nDG COMM webpage on the Critical Raw Materials Act\nQ&A: European Critical Raw Materials Act\nTune in to trade policy insights\n19 December 2024\nEpisode 10\nTom Moylan meets the new Trade and Economic Security Commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, to discuss Mercosur, tariffs, and trust.\n19/12/2024 | Episode 10 | 29 minutes\n14 November 2024\nEpisode 9\nDo you care about where our goods come from?

        "description": "Trade topics\nTrade policy\nThe EU raw materials industry in a nutshell:\nA large number of industries use raw materials as inputs, providing a total added value of €1,300 billion.\n30 million people are employed in the raw materials' industrial sector.\nA sustainable supply of particular raw materials is of crucial importance for the development of green technologies.\nEU trade policy and raw materials\nRaw materials play a significant role in EU trade policy. In concrete terms, the European Commission developed a fully-fledged strategy for raw materials, which was outlined in the 2008 Communication entitled the\nRaw Materials Initiative\n. This was revised in February 2011 in a\nCommunication\n, which further boosted the integration of raw material priorities in EU policies.\nEU trade policy is actively committed to ensuring that international raw materials markets operate in a free and transparent manner. For this purpose, the EU’s trade strategy relies on three pillars:\nDefining the rules of the game through bilateral and multilateral negotiations;\nEnforcing the rules and tackling market barriers when required, and;\nPromoting the debate on raw materials, both in bilateral and multilateral settings.\nThe EU is working with a diverse range of international partners to support and accelerate critical minerals projects and to promote policies that strengthen supply chains of critical minerals via the\nMinerals Security Partnership Forum\n.\nResults on raw materials\nEU-Korea FTA\nincludes the prohibition of duties, taxes or other fees on exportation.\nEU-Singapore FTA\nincludes the prohibition of duties, taxes or measures of an equivalent effect on exportation.\nEU-Central America\n, and\nEU-Colombia/Peru trade agreements\ninclude the prohibition of export duties or taxes, with some minor exceptions.\nWTO accession of Tajikistan: a commitment was secured on the prohibition of export duties or taxes, except for a list of products with bound rates.\nWTO raw materials’ cases against China:\nsuccessful conclusion of the\nfirst WTO case against China’s export restrictions on nine raw materials\n(bauxite, coke, fluorspar, magnesium, manganese, silicon carbide, silicon metal, yellow phosphorus and zinc) which were found in violation of WTO rules and of China’s commitments; a\nsecond case was launched in 2012 against export restrictions applied by China\non another set of products (rare earths, tungsten and molybdenum).\nMore on raw materials\nDG Enterprise and Industry's webpage:\nRaw Materials – International Aspects\nMinerals Security Partnership Forum\nTune in to trade policy insights\n19 December 2024\nEpisode 10\nTom Moylan meets the new Trade and Economic Security Commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, to discuss Mercosur, tariffs, and trust.\n19/12/2024 | Episode 10 | 29 minutes\n14 November 2024\nEpisode 9\nDo you care about where our goods come from?

        "description": "Trade topics\nTechnical Barriers to Trade\nIf these legal requirements are used arbitrarily, they may represent hidden restrictions to international trade.\nThese requirements govern various aspects of a product, such as weight, size, packaging, ingredients, mandatory labelling, or shelf-life conditions. These requirements can take two forms:\nTechnical regulations\noutlining product characteristics, or related processes and production methods with which compliance is mandatory, and;\nStandards\napproved by a recognised body that provides for common use; and rules, guidelines or characteristics for products or related processes and production methods with which compliance is voluntary.\nTo determine whether the relevant requirements are fulfilled, the responsible authorities or economic operators carry out\nconformity assessment\nprocedures\n. These procedures could also be used to unduly restrict trade among countries.\nWhy do Technical Barriers to Trade matter in international trade?\nProducts placed on the market need to comply with a whole range of administrative and technical requirements, including testing and certification, which may differ from one country to another.\nAt times, such different and complex non-tariff measures can become unnecessary trade barriers for millions of companies engaged in international trade. This not only increases their production costs and the time it takes to bring products to market, but also impacts consumers as regards availability, choice and the price of products they would like to purchase.\nEU trade policy and Technical Barriers to Trade\nEU exporters face a number of difficulties and\ntrade barriers\nrelated to these technical requirements, including mandatory standards, and different conformity assessment procedures applicable to products across different jurisdictions.\nThe EU supports the establishment of a strong, transparent, and rules-based multilateral trading system. It is therefore necessary to prevent the application of measures that unduly restrict international trade.\nThe EU works together with its Member States and stakeholders to detect and remove measures that unnecessarily restrict trade, and to prevent new ones from being implemented.\nThe EU seeks to remove these barriers with tools and procedures that are established both multilaterally (within the WTO) and bilaterally (in our agreements with our trading partners).\nThe EU also engages in regulatory cooperation to help ensure that global rules governing the market are consistent.\nPreventing new barriers\nAt WTO level\nThe Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (the\nTBT Agreement\n) is a multilateral agreement administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nWhile allowing all WTO members to maintain their right to adopt regulations to pursue legitimate objectives – such as the protection of public health, consumers and the environment – the TBT Agreement aims to:\nPrevent the creation of unnecessary technical barriers to international trade;\nPrevent the adoption of protectionist measures;\nEncourage global harmonisation of technical requirements and mutual recognition of test results and certificates, and;\nEnhance transparency.\nThe European Union's participation in the TBT Agreement helps businesses in EU Member States access markets in countries outside the EU.\nUnder the TBT Agreement, WTO members must notify their draft technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures to fellow WTO members.\nThis gives all WTO members and economic operators advance knowledge of the measures envisaged, to assess their potential impact on exports and to identify any provisions breaching the TBT Agreement.\nCompanies can use the notification procedure as a source of information on product requirements in non-EU countries. They can make appropriate preparations to make sure their products comply with these requirements.\nWTO members can discuss the envisaged measures with the notifying country. The dialogue can result in an amendment of the notified measure, or even in its withdrawal by the notifying country.\nMore information on how companies can contribute to preventing international trade barriers\nIn bilateral agreements\nThe EU has trade agreements with trading partners around the world. These agreements seek to increase cooperation and facilitate trade between EU members and third countries, going beyond the terms of WTO trade.\nOur bilateral trade agreements include chapters on Technical Barriers to Trade in which the parties undertake to maintain a continuous dialogue that allows for cooperation and exchange of information on barriers.\nThe texts of the agreements contain commitments on Technical Barriers to Trade, such as:\nmore consistent use of international standards;\na risk-based approach to deciding what conformity assessment procedures should be used for assessing compliance of products;\npromotion of supplier declarations of conformity (first-party conformity assessments) for low-risk products, as opposed to third-party conformity assessments;\npromotion of good regulatory practices, and;\nimproved implementation of transparency provisions, to ensure that trade partners are systematically consulted on regulatory initiatives that might significantly influence trade.\nThese commitments deliver benefits for exporters and consumers from both parties to the agreement, as they remove obstacles to trade and reduce technical barriers to trade.\nThey also provide increased market access, new opportunities for companies, and more choice for consumers.\nMore information about the EU’s trade agreements in place and ongoing negotiations\nRegulatory cooperation\nThe EU works together with its trading partners and other stakeholders to build more integrated trading systems. This helps to reduce unnecessary obstacles to trade that domestic regulations may create.\nOne such example is the\nEU-US Trade and Technology Council\nlaunched in 2021, or the Regulatory Cooperation Forum between EU and Canada envisaged by the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.\nRegulatory cooperation can include several different tools, ranging from the informal, such as basic information sharing, to the more formal, which include mutual recognition agreements on conformity assessment and complete harmonisation of regulatory frameworks, such as in the European Economic Area Agreement.\nMutual Recognition Agreements on Conformity Assessment\nMutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) on Conformity Assessment provide for mutual recognition between trading partners of mandatory test results and certificates for certain manufactured products.\nThis makes trade quicker, easier, and cheaper, while maintaining a high level of safety. A\nbusiness survey\nfrom 2022 confirmed the importance of MRAs and the untapped potential offered by such agreements.\nMRAs lay down the conditions under which country A will accept conformity assessment results performed by designated conformity assessment bodies of country B to show compliance with the requirements of country A, and vice-versa.\nMRAs include specific sectors and relevant lists of designated laboratories, inspection bodies and conformity assessment bodies in both the EU and the partner country.\nMore information about the EU’s Mutual Recognition Agreements\nShare this page",

        "description": "Trade topics\nDual use\nThe EU controls the export, transit, brokering and technical assistance of dual-use items so that it can contribute to international peace and security and prevent the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).\nThe export controls take into account the EU and its Member States' international obligations, including:\nUN Security Council Resolution 1540;\nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty;\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention, and;\nthe Biological Weapons Convention.\nEU export controls reflect commitments agreed upon in key multilateral export control regimes such as the\nAustralia Group\n, the\nWassenaar Arrangement\n, the\nNuclear Suppliers Group\n, and the\nMissile Technology Control Regime\n.\nThey contribute to the\nEU's Global Strategy\nand the\nEU Strategy against the Proliferation of WMDs\n.\nThe EU export control system\nRegulation\n(EU) 2021/821\ngoverns the EU's export control regime, which includes:\ncommon export control rules, including a common set of assessment criteria and common types of authorisations (individual, global and general authorisations);\na common EU list of dual-use items;\ncommon provisions for end-use controls on non-listed items, which could be used for example in connection with a WMD programme or for human rights violations;\ncontrols on brokering and technical assistance relating to dual-use items and their transit through the EU;\nspecific control measures and compliance to be introduced by exporters, such as record-keeping and registers, and;\nprovisions setting up a network of competent authorities supporting the exchange of information and the consistent implementation and enforcement of controls throughout the EU.\nIn certain cases, EU Member States may introduce additional controls on non-listed dual-use items because of public security or human rights considerations.\nDual-use items may be traded freely within the EU, except for some particularly sensitive items, whose transfer within the EU remains subject to prior authorisation (\nsee Annex IV of the Regulation\n). The regulation contributes to the goals of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) with regard to trade in nuclear material and to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\nThe regulation is directly applicable throughout the EU. EU countries nevertheless need to take national measures to implement some of its provisions, e.g. enforcement and penalties.\nOverview of national measures\nDual-use export authorisations\nThere are four types of export authorisations in place in the EU export control regime.\nEU General Export Authorisations (EUGEAs):\nEU General Export Authorisations (EUGEAs) allow exports of dual-use items to certain destinations under certain conditions (see Annex II of the Regulation). Regulation (EU) 2021/821 provides for the following EUGEAs:\nexports to Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, the United Kingdom and the United States of America;\nexport of certain dual-use items to certain destinations;\nexport after repair/replacement;\ntemporary export for exhibitions or fairs;\ntelecommunications;\nchemicals;\nintra-group technology transfers, and;\nencryption.\nNational General Export Authorisations (NGEAs):\nNational General Export Authorisations (NGEAs) may be issued by EU Member States if they are consistent with existing EUGEAs and do not refer to items listed in Annex IIg of the Regulation.\nGlobal licenses:\nGlobal licenses can be granted by competent authorities to one exporter and may cover multiple items to multiple countries of destination or end users.\nIndividual licenses:\nIndividual licenses can be granted by competent authorities to one exporter and cover exports of one or more dual-use items to one end-user or consignee in a third country.\nModernisation of the EU export control regime\nExport controls need to be regularly updated to adjust to evolving security risks and threats, rapid developments in science and technology, and changes in world trade.\nFollowing a 2014\ncommunication\nthat set out options to review the EU's export controls, the Commission adopted a\nproposal to modernise the EU export control system\nin September 2016. On 20 May 2021, the European Parliament and the Council adopted\nRegulation (EU) 2021/821\n.\nThe new Export Control Regulation upgrades and strengthens the EU's export control toolbox to respond effectively to evolving security risks and emerging technologies, and allows the EU to effectively protect its interests and values.\nThe Commission regularly holds public consultations, and has a constant dialogue with industry, academia and civil society, in an effort to strike the right balance between security and trade.\nOn 24 January 2024, the Commission published a\nWhite Paper\non Export Controls outlining how to make EU export controls more effective in the context of growing geopolitical tensions, with a view to better upholding international security and safeguarding the EU's security interests.\nStakeholder consultation and outreach\nExport restrictions (sanctions) on dual-use and sensitive technology\nIn certain cases, additional EU restrictive measures (’sanctions’) may apply to dual-use exports.\nEU restrictive measures on exports of sensitive technologies\nFrequently asked questions concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia's actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine\nList of High Priority Battlefield Items\n(February 2024)\nPreventing Russian export control and sanctions evasion: Updated G7 guidance for industry\nUpdated\nguidance\nfor industry, agreed on 24 September by G7 members Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States - along with the European Commission - assists industry in identifying Russian evasion practices, to protect G7 technology from misappropriation, prevent reputational harm, and mitigate liability risk while supporting continued success of export controls and sanctions.\nMore information on dual-use export controls\nRegulation 2023/2616 amending Regulation 2021/821 regarding the list of dual-use items (europa.eu)\n(September 2023)\nRegulation 2021-821 for the control of exports of dual-use items\n(including the updated EU control list of dual-use items)\nAnnual export control reports\nGuidance\nConsultation on the White Paper on Dual-Use Export Controls\n(2 February-30 April 2024)\nDual-use export control: National competent authorities\n(February 2022 update)\nCompilation of national control lists\nDual-use correlation table\nReplies to the public consultation on cyber-surveillance guidance\n(July 2023)\nEU Export Control Handbook for Chemicals\n(2023 edition)\nOther useful links\nLatest news\nNews article\n31 January 2025\nReport highlights EU’s approach to export controls of dual-use items\nA European Commission report assessing patterns of Member-State exports of dual-use items shows that both authorisations and denials for the export of those most sensitive goods is on the rise as compared to 2021.\n1 min read\nNews article\n16 October 2024\nCommission publishes guidelines for cyber-surveillance exporters\nToday, the Commission published guidelines on the export of cyber-surveillance items, aiming to raise awareness of the risks associated with misuse of cyber-surveillance technologies and provide exporters with practical tools to evaluate human rights concerns.\n1 min read\nNews article\n1 October 2024\n2024 Update of the EU Control List of Dual-Use Items\nOn 5 September 2024, the European Commission adopted a Delegated Regulation updating the EU dual-use export control list in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2021/821.\n1 min read\nSee all\nLatest events\nPartner meetings\n4th Joint EU-US stakeholders outreach event Re-export of dual-use items\nWednesday 19 July 2023, 15:00 - 17:00 (CEST)\nOnline only\nLive streaming available\nConferences and summits\n2022 Export Control Forum\nTuesday 6 December 2022, 09:30 - 17:00 (CET)\nLive streaming available\nPartner meetings\n2nd Joint EU-US Stakeholder Outreach on Dual Use Export Controls\nTuesday 19 July 2022, 16:00 - 18:00 (CEST)\nOnline only\nLive streaming available\nSee all\nShare this page",

As natural resources are scarce, the importance of these materials is growing.

The Impact Assessment (IA) analyses likely economic, social, environmental and, whenever relevant, human rights impacts and presents them in a single document.\nThe IA report then helps the Commission and the governments of EU member states to decide whether to approve the launch of a new trade negotiation.\nMore on\nImpact Assessments\nDuring: Sustainability Impact Assessments\nDuring the trade negotiations, a Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) is carried out to provide the Commission with a more in-depth analysis of the potential economic, social, human rights, and environmental impacts of the ongoing negotiations. SIAs are also an opportunity for interested parties in both the EU and in the partner countries to share their views with negotiators.\nSIAs are carried out by independent consultants.\nMore on\nSustainability Impact Assessments\nAfter: Economic Analysis of the Negotiated Outcome\nOnce negotiations of the quantifiable elements of the agreement are finalised, the Commission uses tariff dismantling schedules and information on non-tariff barrier reductions to assess the economic impact of what has been agreed. This Economic Analysis of the Negotiated Outcome (EANO) helps the Council, the European Parliament and eventually legislative bodies in member states with their subsequent approval processes.\nView recent\nEconomic Analyses of the Negotiated Outcome\nLater: Ex post evaluations\nAfter the trade deal has been implemented and enough time has passed to gather an adequate amount of evidence, the Commission will begin an\nex post\nevaluation into the effects of the agreement between the EU and the partner country or region.\nThe results of this evaluation will allow the Commission to understand whether the trade agreement has worked as expected in achieving its objectives.

        "description": "Trade topics\nPolicy analysis\nThe Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) is a DG Trade-specific tool for supporting major trade negotiations. Building on the Impact Assessment, the SIA consists of chapters examining specific subjects in greater depth. SIA chapters cover topics where the agreement is most likely to have an impact on sustainability issues, or where the agreement opens opportunities for achieving non-trade policy objectives.\nThese assessments are an opportunity for stakeholders in both the EU and in the partner countries to share their views with negotiators.\nSIAs have several purposes, including:\nfeeding information into and helping steer the negotiations;\nassessing the changes that are likely to be caused by a trade agreement;\nhelping to identify possible trade-offs, and;\nensuring that the related policy choices are optimised.\nSIAs contribute to sound, evidence-based and transparent trade negotiations.\nFrom this page you can access all the SIA reports ever published and the respective Commission position paper in response to the SIA. You can also learn more about the methodological framework for SIAs.\nHow are the assessments carried out?\nSIAs are independent assessments produced by external consultants and take place during trade negotiations.\nBuilding on the Impact Assessments (IA), the SIA consists of additional in-depth studies prepared in parallel with consultation activities. The SIA goes deeper into specific topics than what is possible to achieve in the IA. It examines in detail the impacts of the agreement on specific themes or sectors, and provides negotiators with actionable recommendations based on a thorough review of the evidence.\nReports are released in draft form for feedback from stakeholders before being finalised. The Commission then prepares a position paper to give its views on the final report and explain how the SIA conclusions have or will influence negotiations.\nSustainability Impact Assessment handbook\nThe European Commission published a second edition of the\nhandbook for sustainability impact assessment\nin 2016. It sets out the main characteristics, objectives and principles of the new generation of SIAs.\nThe handbook should be used alongside the\nGuidelines on the analysis of human rights impact in impact assessments of trade-related policy initiatives\nand the\nBetter Regulation Guidelines\n.\nIf you have a general enquiry about SIAs, please\ncontact us\n.\nOngoing assessments\nThere are currently no documents available for this section.\nCompleted assessments\nEU-India FTA and IPA\nSIA in Support of Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement negotiations between the European Union and the Republic of India\nMore information about the EU-India SIA and how to contribute to it\nPosition paper\nPosition Paper\n- November 2023\nReports\nFinal Report\n,\nCase Studies\nand\nAnnex\n- December 2023\nExecutive Summary\n(\nother languages\n) - December 2023\nDraft Final Report\n,\nCase Studies\nand\nAnnex\n- October 2023\nDraft Executive Summary\n- October 2023\nInception Report\nand\nAnnex\n- April 2023\nExecutive Summary\n(\nother languages\n)\nTerms of Reference\n- August 2022\nEU-Eastern and Southern Africa - Deepening of the EPA\nSIA in Support of Negotiations with Partner Countries in Eastern and Southern Africa in view of Deepening the Existing Interim Economic Partnership Agreement\nMore information about the EU-Eastern and Southern Africa SIA and how to contribute to it\nPosition paper\nPosition Paper\n– February 2023\nReports\nFinal report\n– July 2022\nExecutive Summary\n(\nother languages\n)\nEx-post Evaluation Report\n– May 2021\nInception report\n- October 2020\nTerms of Reference\n- December 2019\nEU-SADC EPA - Angola's accession\nSIA in support of negotiations with Angola in view of Angola’s accession to the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and South African Development Community.\nPosition paper\nPosition Paper\n– March 2023\nReports\nFinal report\n– December 2021\nExecutive Summary\n(\nother languages\n)\nInception report\n- May 2021\nExecutive Summary\n- May 2021\nTerms of Reference\n- January 2021\nEU-Philippines and EU-Malaysia free trade agreement negotiations\nSIAs in support of free trade agreements (FTA) negotiations between the European Union and the Republic of the Philippines and between the European Union and Malaysia\nThese SIA final reports are published in line with DG TRADE’s commitment to transparency in its policy evaluation practices.
