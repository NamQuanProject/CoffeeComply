Facts, figures and latest developments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry or regionAlgeriaTrade topicsNegotiations and agreementsTrade policy\n\n\n\nThe EU-Algeria Association Agreement was signed in April 2002 and entered into force in September 2005.The agreement sets out a framework for the EU-Algeria relationship in all areas, including trade. It reciprocally liberalises trade in goods, with elements of asymmetry in favour of Algeria.It aimed to establish an EU-Algeria free trade area, including the complete dismantling of tariffs, by September 2020 – a target that has been met, save for a few remaining tariffs that Algeria is yet to eliminate.Trade pictureAlgeria is the EU's 22nd biggest trade partner, representing 1% of the EU’s total trade in goods in 2023.The EU is Algeria's biggest trade partner and accounts for the majority of Algeria’s international trade (around 50% in 2023).Total trade in goods between the EU and Algeria in 2023 amounted to €50.2 billion. The EU’s imports from Algeria amounted to €35.4 billion. Imports were dominated by mineral products (€33.9 billion, 96%). The EU’s exports to Algeria amounted to €14.9 billion and were dominated by machinery and appliances (€2.7 billion, 18.1%), closely followed by chemicals (€2.5 billion, 16.9%), and transport equipment (€2.2 billion, 15.2%).  Two-way trade in services amounted to €3.7 billion in 2022. EU imports of services represented €1.4 billion, and exports were worth €2.3 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and AlgeriaThe Free Trade Area (FTA) of the EU-Algeria Association Agreement grants preferential treatment for Algerian exports to the EU. In January 2014, the EU implemented changes to its Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP), which removes import duties from products coming into the EU from some developing countries. As a result, countries that already had preferential market access to the EU, like Algeria due to its FTA, stopped benefiting from the GSP treatment in 2014.The EU and Algeria adopted on 13 March 2017 new Partnership Priorities in the framework of the renewed European Neighbourhood Policy. Together with the joint assessment of the implementation of the Association Agreement, also adopted in March 2017, they constituted the political framework that guided the dialogue of the EU and its Member States with Algeria until 2020. These Partnership Priorities in the context of EU-Algeria relations focused on a variety of areas, including trade and access to the EU single market, energy, the environment and sustainable development.Bilateral trade between the two partners is primarily based on Algerian exports of oil and gas products. Algeria is the EU’s third largest supplier of natural gas, after Russia and Norway. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, gas imports from Russia to the EU have fallen significantly. This has primariliy been compensated for by a sharp increase in imports of liquified natural gas (LNG), particularly from the United States, but also via increased gas imports from Algeria and Norway.In 2021, under the new EU Trade Policy Review, the EU has proposed a new sustainable investment initiative to interested partners in Africa and the Southern Neighbourhood. Fostering strategic interdependencies and enhancing the EU’s relations and economic integration with the Southern Neighbourhood is a strategic necessity for long-term stability.Financial supportThe European Neighbourhood Policy provides political and financial assistance to Algeria. The EU committed €125 million to bilateral assistance for Algeria for the period 2018-2020, under the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI). The funding supported cooperation priorities agreed with Algeria, namely: (i) economic governance and support for economic diversification; (ii) territorial development and participatory democracy; (iii) energy/environment and climate actions. Under the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2021-2027, the EU will adopt a broad new financial cooperation instrument: the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI). The NDICI is the basis of EU-Algeria cooperation.More information on EU support is available from the Directorate-General for the European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations (DG NEAR).Algeria in the Southern NeighbourhoodAlgeria is one of the partners of the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine*, Syria and Tunisia). The EU established its privileged partnership with the Eastern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean back in 1995 with the launch of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership at the Barcelona Conference, aiming to establish an area of peace, stability and economic prosperity that upholds democratic values and human rights.The 25th anniversary of the Barcelona Process in November 2020 was an opportunity to reflect on the strategic partnership with the region in light of the political, socioeconomic, financial and environmental challenges exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and to reassess the EU’s partnership with Algeria and the other Southern Neighbourhood partner countries. Following consultations with partners, this reflection resulted in the Joint Communication by the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on ‘A renewed partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood - A new Agenda for the Mediterranean‘ and the annexed 'Economic and Investment Plan for the Southern Neighbours' in February 2021.More information on the Southern NeighbourhoodThe impact of trade component of the EU’s Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Algeria was assessed in the Ex-Post Evaluation of Trade Chapters of the Six Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements with the EU’s Southern Neighbours, published by the Commission in 2021.According to IMF and World Bank estimates, the Algerian government’s economic diversification plan, if linked to the creation of favourable conditions for the private sector and necessary adjustments to the education and training system, would boost economic growth substantially in the medium term, balancing the short-term costs of transition. Algeria would then be in a position to gain in competitiveness and to benefit from new markets, such as via the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).The pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation and the PEM Convention on rules of originThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation system of origin was created in 2005. It brings together the EU, Algeria and other partners in Europe and the Mediterranean to support regional integration by creating a common system of rules of origin. Rules of origin are technical criteria which determine whether a specific product qualifies for duty-free or other preferential access under a given trade agreement.Cumulation of origin means that a product coming from one partner country can be processed or added to a product of a second partner country and still be considered as an ‘originating product’ of that second partner country for the purposes of a particular trade agreement.The pan-Euro-Mediterranean system allows for diagonal cumulation (i.e. cumulation between two or more countries) between the EU, EFTA countries, Türkiye, the Western Balkans, the Faroe Islands, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and any other country that signed the Barcelona Declaration of 1995. The system was originally based on a network of Free Trade Agreements with identical origin protocols.These individual origin protocols are being progressively replaced by a reference to the Regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin (PEM Convention), which was established in 2011 to provide a more unified framework for origin protocols. Algeria joined the Regional Convention in March 2017.Committees and DialoguesThe EU and Algeria meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the Agreement.Technical committee meetings - agendas and reportsTrading with AlgeriaImporting into the EU from AlgeriaEU trade defence measures on imports from AlgeriaExporting from the EU to AlgeriaTrade defence measures in force in AlgeriaTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with AlgeriaAlgeria is a member of the World Trade OrganizationMore information about EU co-operation programmes for Algeria* This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExporters' stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article14 June 2024EU begins dispute settlement proceedings against Algeria to defend European companiesToday, the EU has launched a dispute settlement case against Algeria and requested consultations with Algerian authorities to address several restrictions imposed on EU exports and investments.1 min readPress release30 August 2021An assertive trade policy: EU’s defence measures against unfair trade practices remained effective in 2020The system for protecting EU businesses from dumped and subsidised imports continued to function well in 2020 thanks to the EU’s robust and innovative ways of using trade defence instruments (TDI).1 min readAll the latest news on EU trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Argentina has been involved in the negotiation of the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement.Trade pictureArgentina is an upper middle-income country and is the third largest economy of Latin America and a G20 member.Argentina is a major producer of agricultural commodities and is among the top world exporters of soy and sunflower products, pears, and lemons. Wine and beef are also well-known products, mostly consumed domestically. Argentina also has important mineral resources such as gold, copper and lithium and respectively the 2nd and the 4th largest shale gas and shale oil reserves in the world. Additionally, it has industrial production in sectors such as  cars, nuclear industry, and an emerging digital service sector.The EU is Argentina's third trading partner (after Brazil and China), accounting for 14.1% of total Argentinean trade in 2019. In 2019, EU-Argentina bilateral trade in goods totalled € 14.3 billion.Argentina’s main exports to the EU are agricultural products (58%), [petroleum-derived] chemicals (15%) and non-fuel raw materials (12%) (2019 data).The EU exports to Argentina mainly manufactured goods, such as machinery and transport equipment (44%) and chemical products, including pharmaceuticals, (24%) (2019 data).In 2019, the value of EU exports of goods to Argentina was practically the same as that of EU imports from Argentina.Trade in services was rather stable between 2016 and 2018. In 2018, the EU imported services from Argentina of a value of €2.2 billion, while it exported services worth €5.3 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and ArgentinaThe EU’s historically strong relationship with Argentina is reflected in the level of Foreign Direct Investment by EU companies, which held stocks worth €43 billion in Argentina in 2018.The EU holds bilateral dialogues with Argentina on economic and trade matters through the EU-Argentina Joint Committee, established under the EU-Argentina Framework Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The last such meeting was held in 2017.Over several decades, Argentina has imposed significant barriers on imports, exports and capital flows. As a result, international trade and investment climate suffered significantly. Although EU companies and investors reported some improvements in administrative procedures during recent years, a number of significant problems remain, which the EU continues to monitor and take up in bilateral contacts with Argentina. Those problems include in particular:Export duties for many products and services ; the tax rate ranges from 5% (including services) to 33% (soy exports),Non-automatic import licences applied to around 1500 tariff lines, affecting almost 26% of EU exports to Argentina,Mandatory preferences for local companies in public procurementlocal content requirements in the car and car-part sector  to obtain tax advantages,Problems in the protection and enforcement of Intellectual Property rights, including delays in patent proceedings and inadequate protection of geographical indications.For more details, search for trade barriers on the Access2Markets portal.Argentina in MercosurMercosur is an economic and political agreement between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.

Negotiations for a region-to-region trade and investment agreement between the EU and ASEAN were launched in 2007 and paused by mutual agreement in 2009 to give way to a bilateral format of negotiations.These bilateral trade and investment agreements were conceived as building blocks towards a future region-to-region agreement.Negotiations with Singapore and Malaysia were launched in 2010, with Vietnam in June 2012, with Thailand in March 2013, with the Philippines in December 2015 and with Indonesia in July 2016.So far, the EU has completed negotiations for bilateral agreements with two of them (Singapore in 2014 and Vietnam in 2015), while negotiations with Malaysia and the Philippines are currently on hold.Negotiations with Indonesia are ongoing and negotiations with Thailand resumed recently, with the goal of further deepening bilateral trade and investment relations with both countries. Bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) between the EU and ASEAN countries can serve as building blocks towards a future EU-ASEAN agreement, which remains a long-term objective.Negotiations of an investment protection agreement with Myanmar (Burma) are put on hold.At regional level, the European Commission and ASEAN Member States undertook a stocktaking exercise to explore the prospect of resuming region-to-region negotiations but concluded that their respective positions remain too far apart. In September 2022, the ASEAN Economic Ministers-EU Consultation resulted in a decision to re-orient the Joint EU-ASEAN Working Group for the development of a Framework setting out the parameters of a future ASEAN-EU FTA. The Joint Working Group will now focus on sectoral cooperation on the digital economy, green technologies and green services, and supply-chain resilience. It is expected to hold its next meeting in June 2023. Trade pictureASEAN as a whole represents the EU's third-largest trading partner outside Europe (after China and the US) with some €252.5 billion of trade in goods in 2023. Bilateral trade in services amounted to €126.1 billion in 2022.The EU is ASEAN’s third-largest trading partner after China and the US, accounting for 8% of ASEAN trade.The EU is the third-largest investor in ASEAN countries. In 2022, its Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) stocks into ASEAN accounted for €400.1 billion. Although a more recent phenomenon, ASEAN investment in Europe has also been growing steadily and impressively to a total stock of over €195.6 billion in 2021.The EU's main exports to ASEAN are chemical products, machinery and transport equipment. The main imports from ASEAN to the EU are machinery and transport equipment, agricultural products, and other manufactured goods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and the Association of South East Asian NationsBesides trade negotiations with individual ASEAN Member States, the EU cooperates closely with the ASEAN region as a whole. Cooperation between the two regions is framed by a biannual ASEAN-EU Trade and Investment Work Programme, which is articulated along the following activities:an EU-ASEAN dialogue, which includes discussions on trade and investment issues at ministerial and senior economic officials levels;biregional expert dialogue groups;cooperation activities, and;regular organisation by business of ASEAN-EU Business Summits.Trade-related assistance to ASEANThe EU also finances regional projects relating to trade such as:ASEAN Regional Integration Support from the EU (ARISE PLUS);COMPASS (Statistics and integration monitoring);ASEAN Project on the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights (ECAP III);ASEAN Air Transport Integration Project (AATIP), and;Enhanced Regional EU-ASEAN Dialogue Instrument (e-READI).Committees and DialoguesThe EU and ASEAN countries meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the agreement.Meetings and documentsTrading with the Association of South East Asian NationsImporting into the EU from the Association of South East Asian NationsEU trade defence measures on imports from the Association of South East Asian NationsExporting from the EU to the Association of South East Asian NationsTrade defence measures in force in the Association of South East Asian NationsTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with ASEAN, Brunei Darussalam, Myanmar/Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This agreement provides broad scope for cooperation, extending to trade and economic development, human rights, good governance and the environment.Bangladesh has been a WTO member since 1995 and, as a least developed country, benefits from the EU's 'Everything but Arms' arrangement, which grants duty-free, quota-free access for all exports, except arms and ammunition.Trade pictureThe EU is Bangladesh's main trading partner, accounting for 20.7% of Bangladesh's total trade in 2023.In 2023, Bangladesh was the EU's 36th largest trading partner in goods (accounting for 0.4% of the EU's total trade).EU imports from Bangladesh are dominated by clothing, accounting for over 90% of the EU's total imports from Bangladesh.In 2023, EU exports to Bangladesh were dominated by machinery and chemical products.Bangladesh is the largest beneficiary under the EU's Everything But Arms (EBA) arrangements. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and BangladeshAs a Least Developed Country (LDC), Bangladesh benefits from the most favourable regime available under the EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP), namely the Everything But Arms (EBA) arrangement. EBA grants the 46 LDCs – including Bangladesh – duty-free, quota-free access to the EU for exports of all products, except arms and ammunition.In July 2013, in response to the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory complex which killed scores of workers, the EU took the initiative of launching a Sustainability Compact for Bangladesh with the aim of improving labour rights and factory safety in the ready-made garment industry. The initiative brings together the EU, the Government of Bangladesh, the USA, Canada – i.e. the main markets for Bangladeshi garment production – as well as the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The Compact is based on three inter-linked pillars:respect for labour rights;structural integrity of buildings and occupational safety and health, and;responsible business conduct.In October 2019, the authorities of Bangladesh agreed to develop a roadmap, the National Action Plan (NAP) on the Labour Sector, with timelines for reforms to improve labour rights – notably the alignment of the Bangladesh Labour Act and the Export Processing Zone Labour Act – with the ILO fundamental conventions. The NAP was published by Bangladesh in September 2021.Trading with BangladeshImporting into the EU from BangladeshEU trade defence measures on imports from BangladeshExporting from the EU to BangladeshTrade defence measures in force in BangladeshTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with BangladeshBangladesh is a member of the World Trade Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Its accession process is still ongoing, but has been suspended following Belarus’ involvement in Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine.In June 2007 the EU withdrew its trade preferences to Belarus under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences, in response to Belarus' violations of the core principles of the International Labour Organisation.Belarus’ exports to the EU are therefore subject to import tariffs at the standard non-preferential rate. Once Belarus has shown that it respects basic trade union rights, the EU is ready to reverse its decision.A Dialogue on Trade was established in October 2016, in order to facilitate exchanges on trade-related matters at experts’ level. The dialogue took place twice a year in July and December up to July 2020. Since then, the dialogue has been suspended, due to the significant deterioration in the human rights, democracy and rule of law situation in Belarus in the run-up, conduct and aftermath of the 9 August 2020 presidential elections, which the EU declared neither free nor fair.Trade picturePlease note that the following figures reflect the situation in 2021, before recent trade-related sanctions began to have an effect.In 2021, the EU was Belarus' second main trade partner, representing 19.9% of the country's overall trade in goods. Russia was Belarus' first trading partner, with 49.0% of  Belarus' international trade.EU-Belarus bilateral trade in goods declined in 2020 by 7.3%, mainly due to the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic. 2021 saw a substantial recovery. Bilateral trade increased by 27.0%, reaching €12.9 billion, although this only represents growth of 13.3% over the past 10 years.Belarus' main exports to the EU (before the current sanctions were introduced) were wood (23.2% of total exports), mineral products (21.6%) and base metals (15.3%). The EU’s main exports to Belarus were machinery (31.2% of total exports), chemicals (15.4%) and transport equipment (12.3%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and BelarusAlthough trade between the EU and Belarus has grown in recent years, the EU has suspended moves towards closer economic partnership with Belarus until political and civil conditions improve in Belarus.The EU has also introduced an Outward Processing Trade regime for Belarus. This regime provides for additional import quota amounts for textiles and clothing manufacturers within the European Union so they can produce garments in Belarus that will return to the EU after processing.Belarus trade restrictionsIn addition to the sanctions imposed against Belarus, including both import and export restrictions, since 2010 the EU has imposed unilateral import quotas for Belarus covering trade in textile and clothing products. The unilateral quotas replaced the EU-Belarus textile agreement that Belarus no longer wanted to renew after joining the Customs Union with Russia and Kazakhstan.Committees and DialoguesAll bilateral dialogue with Belarus is currently suspended.Technical committee meetings - agendas and reportsTrading with BelarusTrade with Belarus is currently heavily restricted by EU sanctions (see news below; 18 March 2022)Importing into the EU from BelarusEU trade defence measures on imports from BelarusExporting from the EU to BelarusTrade defence measures in force in BelarusTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with Belarus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article3 July 2024EU protects sanctions against Russian and Belarussian investors under Energy Charter TreatyIn the context of Russia’s ongoing unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine, the EU’s decision to deny the ECT’s protection to investments and investors from Russia and Belarus pre-emptively nullifies a potential way to challenge EU sanctions.1 min readNews article18 March 2022Practical guidelines on export restrictions to Russia and Belarus publishedToday, the Commission published a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on export-related restrictions concerning dual-use goods and advance technology items. 1 min readNews article16 March 2022EU adjusts steel safeguard quotas following import bansThe EU has today adjusted the import quotas included in the EU’s steel safeguard. 1 min readAll the latest news on EU trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

See Legal Act and Memo. Trade pictureIn 2023, total trade in goods between the EU and Cambodia equalled €5.8 billion. In 2023, the EU ranked as Cambodia's fourth-biggest trade partner, accounting for 8.2% of the country’s total trade (with China at 25.8%, the United States at 19.3%, and Vietnam at 13.9%). Cambodia was the EU’s 65th largest trading partner (accounting for 0.1% of the EU’s total trade). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and CambodiaAs a Least Developed Country (LDC), Cambodia benefits from the most favourable regime available under the EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP), namely the Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme.The EU’s GSP regulation allows vulnerable developing countries to pay fewer or no duties on exports to the EU, giving them vital access to the EU market and contributing to their growth. The EBA scheme is one arm of the GSP, which grants duty-free and quota-free access to the EU for all products (except arms and ammunition) for the world's Least Developed Countries, as defined by the United Nations.Exports of textiles and footwear, bicycles, prepared foodstuffs and vegetable products (rice) represented 94.2 % of Cambodia's overall exports to the EU in 2021. Out of the total exports in 2020, about 93% were eligible to EBA preferential duties.Cambodia and ASEANCambodia is one of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and one of the three LDCs of the organisation.

The European Parliament approved the agreement in June 2013 and it was ratified by Cameroon in July 2014.This agreement lets all goods from Cameroon enter the EU duty and quota-free, and gradually removes duties and quotas over 15 years on 80% of EU exports to Cameroon. It covers trade in goods, aid for trade, institutional issues and dispute settlement.The interim EPA is a ‘stepping-stone’ agreement. This means the EU and partner countries can deepen the agreement through ‘rendez-vous’ clauses which allow further negotiations on trade-related issues like services, competition, intellectual property, etc.Other countries of the region have not yet signed the Economic Partnership Agreement.Chad, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo and São Tomé and Principe, benefit from duty-free, quota-free EU access under the EU's Everything but Arms scheme.Congo (Brazzaville) trades with the EU under the EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP).As upper-middle income countries according to the World Bank classification, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea are not eligible for the GSP or any other preferential EU import regime anymore (since 2014 for Gabon and 2021 for Equatorial Guinea).The EU and the Central African regional organisations (CEMAC and ECCAS) are studying the possibility to reach a comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement through the stepping-stone agreement already used by Cameroon.More information on the interim Economic Partnership Agreement between the EU and the Cameroon (also in French)APE Cameroun: Déclaration officielle démantèlement tarifaireAPE Cameroun: Note technique sur le démantèlement tarifaireAPE Cameroun: Offre d'accès au marché transposée en SH2017Rapport conjoint de monitoring de l'APEi UE-CamerounCommittees and DialoguesThe EU and Central Africa meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the agreement.Meetings and documentsTrading with Central AfricaImporting into the EU from Central AfricaEU trade defence measures on imports from Central AfricaExporting from the EU to Central AfricaTrade defence measures in force in Central AfricaTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo Brazzaville, GabonEU-Central Africa (Cameroon) Economic Partnership Agreement: Creating opportunities for EU and African businesses (factsheet)See how the interim Economic Partnership Agreement is benefiting exporters in Central Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article2 September 2024EU's first Sustainable Investment Facilitation Agreement enters into force with AngolaToday, the EU-Angola Sustainable Investment Facilitation Agreement (SIFA) has entered into force.

The region represents a bridge to China,  Afghanistan and the Middle East. It is a source of significant energy imports for the EU.Central Asia: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, UzbekistanCentral Asian countries share some common features: they are landlocked, their exports focus on raw materials, and they all face significant influence from neighbouring powers, namely Russia or China. Yet they significantly differ from one another in terms of wealth and trade volumes with the EU. Despite some economic growth in recent years, Central Asian countries remain characterised by a low level of economic diversification and a high dependence on a relatively small number of trade partners.Three of the five Central Asian countries (Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan) benefit from favourable access to the EU market, through the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) or GSP+. While Tajikistan meets the standard GSP criteria, the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan have also joined the EU’s GSP+ arrangement, which grants additional preferences. Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, as upper middle income-level economies, can no longer benefit from this scheme.Two Central Asian countries are also members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU): Kazakhstan since 2010 and the Kyrgyz Republic since 2015. Uzbekistan became an EAEU observer in 2020.Trade pictureEU trade with Central Asia has grown and the EU is now the region’s main trade partner, accounting for about a third of its overall external trade. Nevertheless, the total turnover of the EU's trade with Central Asia remains low.The EU is the region's main trading partner, accounting for 23.6% of Central Asian countries' combined foreign trade in 2021. According to preliminary data for 2022, EU goods imports from Central Asia continue to increase (by 67% in 2022) and exports from the EU to Central Asia also grew (by 77%).The EU is also the biggest foreign investor in Central Asia, with over 40% of cumulated investment in the region originating from the bloc. Negotiations for non-preferential enhanced bilateral partnership and cooperation frameworks (EPCAs) also support overall cooperation between the EU and Central Asia. Central Asian exports to the EU largely focus on a few commodities, particularly crude oil, gas, metals and cotton fibre.EU exports are dominated by machinery and transport equipment, and other manufactured goods. Such products account for more than half of EU exports to the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and Central AsiaThe EU adopted a New Central Asia Strategy in 2019, which outlines the EU's strategic interests in the region and focuses on three pillars: increased resilience, regional cooperation, and prosperity.The strategy proposes to forge a stronger and non-exclusive partnership with Central Asian countries for resilience and prosperity. It has since been complemented by the Global Gateway Strategy and the European Green Deal, which are also relevant for the EU’s relations with the region. Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine and the ensuing challenge of preventing the circumvention of EU sanctions against Russia, while seeking even deeper and closer trade relations between the EU and Central Asian countries, will have to be handled in parallel.The overall institutional framework for the EU's cooperation with the region is as follows:The EU's bilateral trade relations with Kazakhstan are covered by an Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA) signed in Astana on 21 December 2015, which entered into force on 1 March 2020. The agreement constitutes the first of its kind signed by the EU with one of its Central Asian partners. It elevates relations between the EU and Kazakhstan to a new level. In May 2023, the Commission received a mandate from the Council to negotiate a Protocol to the EPCA with Kazakhstan as regards the protection of Geographical Indications (GIs) for agricultural products and foodstuffs, wines and spirits.The EU and Kyrgyzstan initialled an EPCA in 2019 which remains to be concluded and signed. Member States agreed on 29 March 2023 to move forward with the EPCA as a mixed agreement and invited the Commission to present proposals for its signature and conclusion at the earliest possible time (after the Council has defined the scope of provisional application of the agreement). The EPCA with Uzbekistan was initialled in July 2022 and the text is currently being prepared for signature. On the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council on 8 December 2022, negotiations for an EPCA with Tajikistan were launched in February 2023. The first round of negotiations with Tajikistan on the trade title of the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement took place in Dushanbe on 1-2 June 2023. Draft texts and negotiating round reports A Partnership and Cooperation Agreement concluded with Turkmenistan in 1998 is yet to be ratified by all EU Member States. Pending ratification, an Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters entered into force on 1 August 2010. Other areas of cooperation remain based on the Trade and Cooperation Agreement signed with the Soviet Union in 1989 and subsequently endorsed by Turkmenistan.The EU has concluded an Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the Kyrgyz Republic, which is now pending signature.Report on negotiations of the EPCA 2017-2019 The EU's Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA) with Uzbekistan was initialled in July 2022.

The ITA, which was signed in December 2023, is of key geopolitical importance. It will boost the competitiveness of businesses on both sides, while providing a shared platform for the development of our net-zero economies.This work will be further underpinned by ongoing initiatives under the Global Gateway, such as the development of critical raw materials value chains for lithium and copper, and the production of green hydrogen in Chile.The agreement will enable the EU and Chile to cooperate as like-minded, lasting partners on global challenges, such as the de-risking of supply chains and the fight against climate change.

The parties reached the political conclusion of the negotiations on 9 December 2022 and signed the modernised agreement on 13 December 2023. The modernised EU-Chile Agreement is composed of two parallel legal instruments:the Advanced Framework Agreement (AFA), that includes a) the Political and Cooperation pillar, and b) the Trade and Investment pillar (inclusive of investment protection provisions), subject to ratification by all Member States, and;the Interim Trade Agreement (ITA) covering only those parts of the trade and investment pillar of the AFA that are of EU exclusive competence (i.e. not including the investment protection provisions), adopted through the EU-only ratification process.While the ITA is now in force, the AFA will enter into force when all EU Member States have completed their respective ratification processes. The ITA will then cease to exist and will be replaced by the AFA.The EU-Chile ITA removes most remaining trade tariffs on goods, facilitates increased trade in services, and makes it easier for small companies to do business between the EU and Chile. For more information: EU-Chile Interim Trade AgreementNegotiating directives adopted by the Council in November 2017 outline the scope of the recent negotiationsDraft negotiating mandate, May 2017EU initial textual proposals for the modernisation negotiations & round reportsSustainability Impact Assessments in support of negotiations for the modernisation of the trade part of the Association Agreement with ChileTrading with ChileImporting into the EU from ChileEU trade defence measures on imports from ChileExporting from the EU to ChileTrade defence measures in force in ChileAccess2Markets: Information on the EU-Chile ITA Trade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with ChileChile is a member of the World Trade Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExporters' stories\nFrance - Fresh water from a French firmThe 2003 EU-Chile trade deal cut import taxes and other trade barriers.

This represents a decline of 14% compared to 2022. China is the EU's third-largest partner for exports and the biggest for imports. The EU-China trade balance has been persistently in favour of China. In 2023, the EU deficit amounted to €292 billion. EU exports to China amounted to €223.6 billion, whereas EU imports from China amounted to €515.9 billion, indicating year-on-year decreases of 3.1% and 18% respectively.At the European Council in June 2023, EU Member States reaffirmed the EU’s multifaceted policy approach towards China, outlined in its 2019 strategic outlook. China is simultaneously a partner, a competitor, and a systemic rival. However, the balance of challenges and opportunities presented by China has shifted over time. Our economic relationship is critically unbalanced, both in terms of trade flows and of investment, due to a significant asymmetry in our respective market openings. In addition, China’s economic model has brought about systemic distortions with negative spillovers to trading partners. According to the IMF, China’s use of industrial policies, notably its support to priority sectors, has an impact on trading partners. For the EU, ensuring reciprocity, achieving a level-playing field, and addressing asymmetries in the relationship are matters of priority. The EU remains committed to addressing these challenges through dialogue with China and underscores the importance of the WTO as the best avenue to address the root causes of the current imbalance. On 30 December 2020, the EU and China concluded in principle negotiations on the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEU-China agreementThe EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment in focus.Being adopted or ratified\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade pictureOn trade in goods, the EU has long had a trade deficit with China, which reached a record level of €396 billion in 2022. In 2023, the deficit decreased to €292 billion. However, it remains the EU’s second-highest bilateral deficit with China ever. In addition, imports from China have decreased in value, but they are reported to have increased in volume terms.In 2023, the goods that the EU most imported from China were: telecommunications equipment, electrical machinery and apparatus, and automatic data-processing machines. The goods that the EU most exported to China in 2023 were: motor cars and vehicles, medicaments, and other machinery. As regards trade in services, the EU has long had a trade surplus with China. In 2023, the surplus amounted to €14.1 billion. China is the EU’s fourth-biggest services trading partner after the United States, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. The cumulative value of EU foreign direct investment (FDI) stocks in China since 2000 stood at €177 billion in Q1 2024. EU FDI flows to China reached €6.4 billion in 2023 – a decrease of 29% compared with 2022. The top three sectors were the automotive sector, basic materials, and machinery. The cumulative value of Chinese FDI stocks in the EU-27 since 2000 stood at €143 billion in Q1 2024. Chinese FDI flows to the EU amounted to €4.7 billion in 2023, a decrease of 10% compared with 2022. The top three sectors were the automotive sector; health, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; and information and communication technology. While mergers and acquisitions made up the bulk of China’s investments until 2021, in 2022 and 2023 greenfield investment made up most of China’s FDI in the EU.Consult the latest available data on investment between the EU and China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and ChinaThe EU sees China as a partner for cooperation, an economic competitor, and a systemic rival. Recently, EU-China relations have become increasingly complex. In recent years, the EU has conveyed its growing concerns regarding systemic imbalances that characterise the Chinese economy. China’s distortive industrial policies and practices – in particular with regard to widespread support for the manufacturing sector – create overcapacity in China, with negative externalities for a wide range of WTO members.Another area of concern is China’s drive towards import substitution and self-sufficiency. While the EU welcomes efforts by the Chinese authorities to attract foreign direct investment, EU companies continue to face discrimination in the Chinese market, and it remains difficult for European businesses in China to compete due to the lack of a level playing field. Moreover, despite the Chinese government’s stated ambition to pursue a high-level opening of its market and build mutually beneficial trade partnerships, China still remains largely closed in many important sectors. Many European companies feel that the business environment in China has become more politicised over the years. Economic challenges have increased, while regulatory obstacles have remained largely unchanged, which has further negatively impacted the business outlook. A complex and non-transparent legal framework on cybersecurity, combined with restrictive rules on cross-border data flows subject to broadly applied security approvals, insufficient enforcement of intellectual property rights and requirements leading to technology transfer, and a broad concept of national security all further affect the business environment. The EU is committed to de-risking, not decoupling from China. This entails reducing critical dependencies and vulnerabilities, including in EU supply chains, and diversifying where necessary. At the same time, recognising the importance of maintaining open communication channels, the EU continues to pursue cooperation with China at both bilateral and multilateral level. The EU and China discuss policies and issues regarding trade and investment in a range of dialogues, of which the most important are:The Annual EU-China Summit: Presidential-level exchange to enhance policy coordination on the most important issues, including trade, and;The EU-China High Level Economic and Trade Dialogue (HLED): a Vice-President of the European Commission and the Chinese Vice Premier meet to discuss issues. They are accompanied, if needed, by EU commissioners and Chinese ministers. At global level, the EU is committed to working to reform the World Trade Organisation to respond to the challenges of the Green and Digital Transitions, while promoting a global level playing field. The EU calls on China to play a part commensurate to its economic weight to help achieve these reform objectives.Trading with ChinaImporting into the EU from ChinaEU trade defence measures on imports from ChinaExporting from the EU to ChinaTrade defence measures in force in ChinaTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with ChinaChina is a member of the World Trade OrganizationEU-China trade issues referred to the WTO Dispute Settlement Body by the EU against China and by others, including China against the EUThe European Union Chamber of Commerce in China (EUCCC) celebrates European companies’ success in China, but also urges China's leaders not to turn inwardThe EU supports European SMEs in exporting to and investing in China, and also offers SMEs specific advice on IPR issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article11 April 2025EU takes action against dumped imports of food flavour enhancer The European Commission has extended its anti-dumping measures on imports of monosodium glutamate (MSG) from China, to cover imports from Malaysia.1 min readNews article19 March 2025EU imposes duties on dumped glass fibre yarns from ChinaThe Commission has imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of glass fibre yarns from China, directly protecting 1,200 EU jobs and further shielding the EU’s glass fibre sector from unfair trading practices.1 min readNews article14 March 2025Commission imposes duties on unfairly subsidised imports of aluminium road wheels from MoroccoThe European Commission has imposed countervailing duties on imports of aluminium road wheels from Morocco, shielding EU producers and defending 16,600 jobs from unfair trading practices.1 min readAll the latest news on EU trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The Agreement is a first-generation agreement which entered into force in 1997, focusing on tariff liberalisation for goods.The EU is the Faroe Islands’ largest trading partner by far, followed by Russia, the UK, China and Norway. The Faroe Islands are included in the EU’s Arctic Policy, where the EU is committed to investing in the future of people living in the Arctic, stimulating better education, sustainable growth and jobs.Trade pictureThe EU is the Faroe Islands’ biggest trading partner, accounting for 36.9% of the country’s total trade in goods with the world in 2023. 52.5% of the Faroe Islands’ imports came from the EU, and 24.1% of the islands' exports went to the EU. Total trade in goods between the EU and the Faroe Islands in 2023 amounted to €1.8 billion. The EU’s imports represented €773 million, and were dominated by fishery products (€648 million, 84%). The EU’s exports totalled €1.031 million, led by manufactured products (€577 million, 56%). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and the Faroe IslandsThe Faroe Islands have a unique relationship with the EU given that it is neither part of the EU, nor a member of the EEA unlike Norway and Iceland, nor an Overseas Country and Territory, like Greenland. With extensive autonomy under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark, the Faroe Islands decided not to become a part of the European Communities when Denmark joined in 1973. As such, the Treaties do not apply to the Faroe Islands (TFEU Article 355, 5 (a)). Formal relations between the EU and the Faroe Islands are currently based on three separate bilateral agreements dealing with fisheries, trade in goods and scientific and technological cooperation.In March 2024, the EU and the Faroe Islands signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on enhanced cooperation. The MoU recognises shared values, principles and commitments to democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights, peace and stability, international law, and sustainable development.The Free Trade Agreement between the EU and the Faroe Islands, which covers trade in goods, came into effect in 1997. The Agreement was supplemented in 1999 with a Protocol on Veterinary Matters.Committees and DialoguesThe Joint Committee established by the Agreement is responsible for ensuring the proper implementation of the Agreement and meets regularly to consider relevant issues.Technical committee meetings agendas and reportsTrading with the Faroe IslandsRules and requirements for trading with the Faroe Islands:Importing into the EU from the Faroe IslandsEU trade defence measures on imports from the Faroe IslandsExporting from the EU to the Faroe IslandsExport rules on food and plant healthTrade defence measures in force in the Faroe IslandsThe Faroe Islands is a self-governing territory of Denmark and is covered by Denmark's membership of the WTO.Trade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with the Faroe Islands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It has been in force since 1 July 2016.The agreement introduces a preferential trade regime – the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA). This regime increases market access between the EU and Georgia based on having better-matched regulations. The DCFTA has been provisionally applied since 1 September 2014.Trade agreements with Georgia and Moldova – evaluationGeorgia has been a member of the World Trade Organisation since 2000.Trade pictureThe EU is the main trade partner of Georgia. 20.9% of its trade takes place with the EU, followed by Turkey (13.8%) and Russia (11.1%).EU trade with Georgia accounts for 0.1% of its total trade, with a turnover of around €4.36 billion in 2023.EU exports to Georgia amounted to €3.6 billion in 2023, an increase of 11.9% compared to the previous year. The key export products are mineral products, machinery and appliances, and transport equipment.The key EU imports from Georgia include mineral products, chemical products, and textiles. The EU imported goods to the value of €752 million from Georgia in 2023, with imports decreasing by 27.5% since 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and GeorgiaThe DCFTA creates a closer economic integration of Georgia with the EU based on reforms in trade-related areas. It is based on the principles of the World Trade Organisation.  It removes all import duties on goods and provides for broad mutual access to trade in services. It allows EU and Georgian companies to set up a subsidiary or a branch office on a non-discriminatory basis. This allows the foreign company to benefit from the same treatment as domestic companies in the partner’s market.The DCFTA is a vehicle to allow to bring Georgian trade-related legislation closer to selected pieces of the EU legal framework. This will improve governance, strengthen the rule of law and provide more economic opportunities by expanding the EU market to Georgian goods and services. It will also attract foreign investment to Georgia.Georgia and the European Neighbourhood PolicyGeorgia is a partner country of the Eastern Partnership within the European Neighborhood Policy. In 2014, the EU and Georgia agreed an Association Agenda. The Agenda outlines the priorities for reform in Georgia, and is based on the commitments included in the 2014 Association Agreement. On 6 September 2022, the revised Association Agenda for 2021-2027 was adopted.On 3 March 2022, Georgia presented its application for EU membership. On 17 June 2022, the European Commission presented its opinions on the applications for EU membership submitted by Ukraine, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova. Based on the Commission’s opinion on Georgia’s application for EU membership, Georgia was given an EU membership perspective on 23 June 2022, by unanimous agreement between the leaders of all 27 EU Member States. Georgia was granted candidate status on 14 December 2023, on the understanding that the relevant steps set out in the Commission recommendation of 8 November 2023 are taken. The EU issues annual implementation reports to document the steps undertaken by Georgia in the reform process.Committees and DialoguesThe EU and Georgia meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the Agreement.Technical committee meetings - agendas and reportsTrading with GeorgiaImporting into the EU from GeorgiaEU trade defence measures on imports from GeorgiaExporting from the EU to GeorgiaTrade defence measures in force in GeorgiaTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with GeorgiaGeorgia is a member of the World Trade OrganizationDCFTA and Industrial productsDCFTA and InvestmentReading guide to the DCFTATrade Sustainability Impact Assessment in support of negotiations of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) between the EU and respectively Georgia and the Republic of Moldova\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The GCC region is the EU’s 6th largest export market and an important source and destination of investment for EU Member States.The GCC countries have formed their own customs union and are working towards the goal of completing an internal market.EU-GCC relations are based on a Cooperation Agreement from 1988, which establishes regular dialogues on cooperation between the EU and GCC on trade and investment issues, macro-economic matters, climate change, energy, the environment, and research. Regular ‘Senior Official Meetings’ between the EU and individual GCC countries also cover trade and investment-related issues.A more structured informal EU-GCC Dialogue on Trade and Investment was launched in May 2017.Trade pictureThe EU is the GCC's 2nd biggest trade partner of, representing 11.1% of the GCC’s total trade in goods with the world in 2023. 16.2% of the GCC’s imports came from the EU in 2023. The EU thus ranked as the GCC’s number two import partner. In 2023, the EU was the GCC's 4th biggest export partner, as 7.5% of the region’s exports went to the EU.EU-GCC total trade in goods in 2023 amounted to €170,1 billion. The EU’s imports were worth €76.3 billion. They were led by fuel and mining products (€58.3 billion, 76.4%) and manufactured goods (€5.8, 7.6%). The EU’s exports totalled €93.7 billion and were dominated by machinery and transport equipment (€38.8 billion, 41.4%), chemicals (15.3 billion, 16.3%), and miscellaneous manufactured articles (€12.3 billion, 13.1%).Two-way trade in services between the EU and the GCC in 2022 amounted to €68.9 billion, with EU’s imports of services representing €24.5 billion and exports €44.4 billion.In 2022, total EU outward foreign direct investment stock in the GCC region amounted to €215.8 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and the Gulf region1988’s EU-GCC Cooperation Agreement provides the framework for economic and political cooperation between the EU and the GCC countries. The agreement seeks to improve trade relations and stability in a strategic part of Europe's neighbourhood. It created a Joint Council and a Joint Cooperation Committee.The two sides meet on an annual basis to discuss trade, investment and regional cooperation, amongst other topics, within the EU-GCC Joint Cooperation Committee held in Riyadh or Brussels.In May 2017, the EU and the GCC launched a dedicated Dialogue on Trade and Investment Issues, involving the private sector. The dialogue tackles trade and investment-related issues and enhances cooperation on matters of mutual interest, such as market access irritants, regulatory requirements and ways to encourage greater two-way trade and investment flows.The World Bank classifies the six GCC countries as high-income economies.Therefore they do not benefit from preferential access to the EU market under the EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP).More details on the EU's Generalised Scheme of PreferencesThe EU-GCC Dialogue on Economic Diversification has been working since 2019 to develop connections and to build partnerships based on the exchange of EU experience and expertise to assist GCC countries in their economic diversification strategies.The project has helped to identify new business opportunities and areas of economic cooperation between the two regions, as well as between the EU and individual GCC countries.EU-Gulf Cooperation Council trade negotiationsThe EU and GCC launched negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in 1990. The FTA was meant to provide for the progressive and reciprocal liberalisation of trade in goods and services. However, negotiations were suspended in 2008 as they faced several challenges.In parallel with the negotiations, the prospective EU-GCC FTA was subject to a sustainability impact assessment.Committees and DialoguesThe EU and GCC meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the Agreement.Technical committee meetings - agendas and reportsTrading with the Gulf regionImporting into the EU from the Gulf regionEU trade defence measures on imports from the Gulf regionExporting from the EU to the Gulf regionTrade defence measures in force in the Gulf regionTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with Saudi Arabia and United Arab EmiratesGulf Cooperation Council\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article8 May 2024EU welcomes first European Chamber of Commerce in the Gulf, based in Saudi ArabiaThe European Commission welcomes today’s launch of the European Chamber of Commerce in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (ECCKSA).1 min readNews announcement17 November 20237th EU-GCC Business Forum: Redefining Economies for a Sustainable and Diversified FutureBusinesses and government leaders from the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council will convene at the 7th EU-GCC Business Forum. a pivotal event set to redefine economic collaboration in the post-pandemic era.2 min readNews article31 March 2022EU knocks down barriers to exports of ceramic tilesAs of today, 31 March 2022, EU exporters of ceramic tiles will no longer need to undergo redundant testing or product audits when they export to Saudi Arabia, meaning exporting will become cheaper, faster and more predictable. 1 min readAll the latest news on EU trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Iceland's exports to the EU mainly consist of fuels and mining products, and food and live animals.Iceland grants duty-free market access for most fish and fishery products. The EU also applies tariff concessions on some fish and fishery products originating in Iceland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and IcelandAs a member state of the European Economic Area (EEA), Iceland fully applies EU laws about the four freedoms (free movement of goods, persons, services and capital), along with laws related to other areas of EU and EEA cooperation.As a result, the EEA agreement creates a lot of economic integration, common competition rules, rules for state aid and government procurement between Iceland and the EU.Agriculture and fisheries are not covered by the EEA agreement. However the agreement emphasises the commitment of the parties to a gradual opening up of agricultural trade, which is done by concluding separate agreements. The latest agreement on agricultural products, concluded on the basis of Article 19 of the EEA, is from 2017. As a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), Iceland seeks to conclude bilateral free trade agreement in the so-called EFTA framework. This means that Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein can negotiate a free trade agreement with a respective third country via EFTA.Trading with IcelandImporting into the EU from IcelandEU trade defence measures on imports from IcelandExporting from the EU to IcelandTrade defence measures in force in IcelandTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with IcelandIceland is a member of the World Trade Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

India is already an important trade and investment partner for the EU and could hold significant further potential. It represents a sizable and dynamic market, with an annual projected GDP growth rate of over 8% according to the IMF, which would make it the fastest-growing emerging economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEU-India agreementEU-India Free Trade Agreement, Investment Protection Agreement and Geographical Indications AgreementBeing negotiated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade pictureThe EU is India's largest trading partner, accounting for €124 billion worth of trade in goods in 2023 or 12.2% of total Indian trade, topping the USA (10.8%) and China (10.5%). The EU is the second-largest destination for Indian exports (17.5% of the total) after the USA (17.6%), while China only ranks fourth (3.7%).India is the EU’s 9th largest trading partner, accounting for 2.2% of the EU's total trade in goods in 2023, well behind the USA (16.7%), China (14.6%), or the UK (10.1%).Trade in goods between the EU and India has increased by almost 90% in the last decade.Trade in services between the EU and India reached €59.7 billion in 2023, up from €30.4 billion in 2020.  The EU's share in foreign investment stock in India reached €108.3 billion in 2022, up from €82.3 billion in 2019, making the EU a leading foreign investor in India. This is significant, but way below EU foreign investment stocks in China (€247.5 billion) or Brazil (€293.4 billion).Some 6,000 European companies are present in India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and IndiaA key EU objective in its trade relations with India is to work towards a sound, transparent, open, non-discriminatory and predictable regulatory and business environment for European companies trading with or investing in India, including the protection of their investments and intellectual property. The aim is to contribute to unlocking the untapped potential of two-way trade and investment between the EU and India.Currently, India’s trade regime and regulatory environment remains relatively restrictive. Technical barriers to trade (TBT), sanitary and phyto-sanitary (SPS) measures, deviation from internationally-agreed standards, as well as discrimination based on legislative or administrative measures by India, affect a wide range of sectors, including goods, services, public procurement and investment.The EU uses all available channels and fora to work with India to ensure fair market access and predictable investment conditions, as well as to promote the full respect by both sides of their multilateral obligations under the World Trade Organization (WTO). Key instruments in this respect are the EU-India High-Level Dialogue on Trade and Investment established in 2021 by a decision of the July 2020 EU-India Summit, as well as the EU-India Trade Sub-Commission established under the 1994 Cooperation and Partnership Agreement between the EU and India, and its specialised working groups and dialogues.For more informationMore information on the EU-India strategic partnership, including in the area of trade and investment, can be found on the new EU Strategy for India adopted on 20 November 2018 and the related Council conclusions.Also relevant are the joint statements adopted on the occasion of the EU-India Summit held on 15 July 2020 and the EU-India Leaders’ Meeting held on 8 May 2021.EU-India trade negotiationsOn 8 May 2021, the EU and Indian leaders’ agreed to resume negotiations for a “balanced, ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial” trade agreement, and to launch separate negotiations on an investment protection agreement and an agreement on geographical indications (GIs). Leaders also agreed to link trade negotiations to finding “solutions to long-standing market access issues”.Both sides are now engaged in bilateral negotiations on trade, investment protection and geographical indications.

It represents about 1/3 of the region's GDP and has the largest population (275.5 million inhabitants in 2022).Bilateral trade in goods between the EU and Indonesia amounted to €29.7 bn in 2023, with EU exports worth €11.3 bn and EU imports worth €18.3 bn.The EU is Indonesia's fifth-largest trading partner, while Indonesia is the EU's 33rd biggest trading partner, and the EU's fifth-biggest ASEAN trading partner in 2023.Bilateral trade in services between EU and Indonesia in 2022 amounted to €9.3 bn, with EU exports amounting to €7 bn and imports amounting to €2.3 bn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and IndonesiaOver many years, relations have been framed by the EC Cooperation Agreement with the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which was formalised in 1980. On this basis, economic and political discussions have been held regularly. Bilateral dialogues between the EU and Indonesia have included periodic reviews of political, economic and co-operation issues in Senior Official Meetings.A Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership and Co-operation was signed on 9 November 2009 and entered into force on 1 May 2014. The Agreement provides the basis for holding regular political dialogue and sectoral cooperation and takes bilateral relations to a higher level. The Agreement provides the legal framework to engage and cooperate across a wide spectrum of policy fields, including human rights, political dialogue, and trade.Following successful exploratory discussions to further deepen EU-Indonesia trade and investment relations, negotiations for an EU-Indonesia FTA were launched on 18 July 2016. The ambition is to conclude a FTA that facilitates trade and investments and covers a broad range of issues, including tariffs, non-tariff barriers to trade, trade in services and investment, trade aspects of public procurement, competition rules, intellectual property rights as well as sustainable development.A Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and Indonesia was launched in 2018 and concluded in 2020. The SIA assessed how trade and trade-related provisions in the proposed FTA could potentially impact economic, social, human rights and environmental elements in each trading partner and in other relevant countries.The final report and the Commission position paper can be found on the dedicated Sustainability Impact Assessments page.Indonesia in ASEANIndonesia is one of the 10 members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the largest economy in the region in terms of GDP (35%) and the EU’s 5th largest trading partner in ASEAN. It is also one of the fastest growing economies in South East Asia (average GDP growth of approximately 6% in the past 10 years).More information on ASEANTrading with IndonesiaImporting into the EU from IndonesiaEU trade defence measures on imports from IndonesiaExporting from the EU to IndonesiaTrade defence measures in force in IndonesiaTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with IndonesiaIndonesia is a member of the World Trade Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article10 January 2025WTO confirms validity of EU climate-based actions in renewable energy dispute brought by IndonesiaIn a ruling published today, the World Trade Organization (WTO) upheld the EU’s ability to take environmental and climate-based action under the Renewable Energy Directive (‘RED II’).2 min readNews article5 March 2024WTO rules on renewable energy disputeIn a ruling published on 5 March 2024, the World Trade Organization (WTO) upheld the EU’s ability to take environmental and climate-based action under the Renewable Energy Directive (‘RED II’).2 min readNews article7 July 2023EU launches consultation on use of Enforcement Regulation on Indonesian nickel export restrictionsToday, the Commission has launched a consultation on the possible use of the Enforcement Regulation in its dispute settlement case on Indonesian nickel export restrictions.1 min readAll the latest news on EU trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The EU sees closer trade ties with Iraq as an important part of the reconstruction and development of Iraq.Trade pictureIraq is the EU’s 39th biggest trade partner, representing 0.3% of the EU’s total trade in goods with the world in 2020.The EU is Iraq's 4th biggest trade partner, representing 12.1% of Iraq’s total trade in goods with the world in 2020. 11.3% of Iraq’s imports came from the EU and 12.7% of the country’s exports came from the EU.Total trade in goods between the EU and Iraq in 2020 amounted to €10.8 billion. The EU’s imports were worth €7.3 billion and they mostly consisted of fuel and mining products (€7.25 billion, 99.3%). The EU’s exports totalled €3.5 billion. They were more diverse than the imports and were dominated by machinery and transport equipment (€1.4 billion, 40.0%), which were followed by agriculture and raw materials (€0.7% billion, 20.0%) as well as chemicals (€0.7 billion, 20.0%).Two-way trade in services between the EU and Iraq in 2019 amounted to €1.27 billion, with EU imports of services representing €0.63 billion and exports €0.64 billion.Total EU FDI outward stock in Iraq in 2019 equalled €5.3 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and IraqThe EU-Iraq Partnership and Cooperation Agreement was signed on 11 May 2012. Its trade provisions entered into force provisionally on 1 August 2012; the full agreement was implemented in August 2018 once it was ratified by the EU, its Member Sates and the Iraqi Government.The agreement has a wide coverage of policy sectors including trade in goods, trade in services, trade related issues such as Intellectual Property Rights, technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phytosanitary issues and a dispute settlement method. It provides preferential elements and substantial market access to EU companies, namely in public procurement (the same treatment that national companies get), services and establishment and investment in Iraq.The last meeting of the EU-Iraq Sub-committee on trade and related policies took place on 15 December 2020.Iraq is not a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Iraq was granted observer status in February 2004 and requested to join the WTO in September 2004. The EU supports Iraq's accession to the WTO and believes that WTO membership will enhance structural reform in the country and reintegration into the multilateral trading system. The EU-Iraq Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is a non-preferential trade agreement, which uses basic WTO rules.On 22 January 2018, the EU adopted a new strategy for Iraq with several strategic objectives including the promotion of sustainable, knowledge-based and inclusive economic growth as well as job creation.Financial aidThe EU is a leading donor in Iraq. Since 2014, the EU has provided over €478 million in humanitarian aid to displaced Iraqis and Syrian refuges in Iraq.In 2016, the EU adopted a special measure in favour of Iraq for the Funding Facility for Stabilization.More information is available from the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations.Committees and DialoguesThe EU and Iraq meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the Agreement.Technical committee meetings - agendas and reportsTrading with IraqImporting into the EU from IraqEU trade defence measures on imports from IraqExporting from the EU to IraqTrade defence measures in force in IraqTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with IraqIraq is a member of the World Trade Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The agreement aims to provide an appropriate legal and institutional framework for political dialogue and economic cooperation between the EU and Israel.Trade pictureIsrael is the EU’s 25th biggest trade partner, representing 0.8% of the EU’s total trade in goods in 2022. It is also among the EU’s main trading partners in the Mediterranean area.The EU is Israel’s biggest trade partner, accounting for 28.8% of its trade in goods in 2022. 31.9% of Israel’s imports came from the EU, and 25.6% of the country’s exports went to the EU.Total trade in goods between the EU and Israel in 2022 amounted to €46.8 billion. The EU’s imports from Israel were worth €17.5 billion and were led by machinery and transport equipment (€7.6 billion, 43.5%), chemicals (€3.5 billion, 20.1%), and other manufactured goods (€1.9 billion, 11.1%). The EU’s exports to Israel amounted to €12.2 billion and were dominated by machinery and transport equipment (€12.3 billion, 41.9%), chemicals (€5.1 billion, 17.6%), and other manufactured goods (€3.5 billion, 12.1%).Two-way trade in services between the EU and Israel amounted to €16.7 billion in 2021. EU imports of services represented €6.9 billion, while exports accounted for €9.8 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and IsraelTrade relations between the EU and Israel are governed by a Free Trade Area that is part of 2000's EU-Israel Association Agreement.Negotiations to open up additional agricultural trade between the EU and Israel were concluded in 2008. That agreement has been in force since January 2010.In 2012, the EU and Israel concluded an Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) in pharmaceuticals. It facilitates bilateral trade, removes trade barriers and provides mutual recognition of pharmaceutical certification.Trade and economic relations between the EU and Israel are further enhanced by the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement (the so-called ‘Open Skies’ aviation agreement), which fully entered into force in 2018 and further opened EU-Israel air travel.February 2021’s EU Trade Policy Review stated that the EU will propose a new sustainable investment initiative to interested partners in Africa and the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood. Fostering strategic interdependencies and enhancing the EU’s relations and economic integration with its Southern Neighbourhood is a strategic necessity for long-term regional stability.Goods originating from Israeli settlements in territories that have been under Israeli administration since June 1967 are not entitled to benefit from any preferential tariff treatment (neither under the EU-Israel Association Agreement, nor under the Interim Association Agreement on Trade and Cooperation signed with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on behalf of the Palestinian Authority). This differentiation between products originating in Israel and the settlements is ensured via a 'Technical Arrangement' between the EU and Israel customs authorities, which has been in force since 2004.  The Arrangement requires proofs of origin issued in Israel to identify the place where the production process relevant for rules of origin purposes occurred. A list is published by the Commission identifying (by name and postal code), the areas occupied by Israel since 1967. That list is updated regularly (most recently in June 2023). Importers cannot request preferential treatment for goods originating in such areas.In practical terms, this means that Israeli certificates of origin indicate the postal codes of the place of manufacture that enable EU Member States’ customs to identify the real origin of products. Only products originating in Israel proper are granted trade preferences under the EU-Israel Association Agreement. In case they come from an Israeli settlement they are denied preferential treatment when imported into the EU.Monitoring of the correct origin indication by importers is the task of Member States’ customs authorities.Moreover, to further ensure the correct implementation of the Technical Arrangement with Israel (with the ultimate objective that Israeli exports from the settlements should not benefit from any trade preferences), DG TAXUD on 16 May 2023 introduced a new customs code. It does not imply any modification to the Technical Arrangement, but it is just related to its implementation.Financial supportThe European Neighbourhood Policy provides political and financial assistance to Israel. Due to Israel’s advanced level of economic development, EU funds under the European Neighborhood Instrument (ENI) are mostly used for twinning and public administration (TAIEX) projects in the areas of education, telecommunication and water management. On average, this amounts to €1.8 million per year.Under the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2021-2027, the EU will adopt a broad new financial cooperation instrument: the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI). The NDICI will replace ENI and contribute to future EU-Israel cooperation.More information on EU support is available from the Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations.Israel in the Southern NeighbourhoodIsrael is one of the partners of the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine*, Syria and Tunisia). The EU established its privileged partnership with the countries of the Eastern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean back in 1995 with the launch of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership at the Barcelona Conference, aiming to establish an area of peace, stability and economic prosperity that upholds democratic values and human rights.The 25th anniversary of the Barcelona Process in November 2020 was an opportunity to reflect on the strategic partnership with the region in light of the political, socioeconomic, financial and environmental challenges exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and to reassess the EU’s partnership with Israel and other Southern Neighbourhood partner countries. Following consultations with partners, this reflection resulted in the Joint Communication by the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on ‘A renewed partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood - A new Agenda for the Mediterranean‘ and the annexed ’Economic and Investment Plan for the Southern Neighbours‘ in February 2021.More information on the Southern NeighbourhoodThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation and the PEM Convention on rules of originThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation system of origin was created in 2005. It brings together the EU, Israel, and other partners in Europe and the Mediterranean to support regional integration by creating a common system of rules of origin. Rules of origin are technical criteria which determine whether a specific product qualifies for duty-free or other preferential access under a given trade agreement.Cumulation of origin means a product coming from one partner country can be processed or added to a product of a second partner country and still be considered an ‘originating product’ of that second partner country for the purposes of a particular trade agreement.The pan-Euro-Mediterranean system allows for diagonal cumulation (i.e. cumulation between two or more countries) between the EU, EFTA countries, Turkey, the Western Balkans, the Faroe Islands, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, and any country that signed the Barcelona Declaration of 1995. The system was originally based on a network of Free Trade Agreements with identical origin protocols.These individual origin protocols are being progressively replaced by a reference to the Regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin (PEM Convention), which was established in 2011 to provide a more unified framework for origin protocols. Israel signed the Regional Convention on 10 October 2013, and it has also ratified it.More information on Mediterranean preferential Rules of OriginTrading with IsraelImporting into the EU from IsraelEU trade defence measures on imports from IsraelExporting from the EU to IsraelTrade defence measures in force in IsraelTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with IsraelIsrael is a member of the World Trade Organization* This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Kazakhstan is the first Central Asian partner to have concluded an EPCA with the EU.The EU is Kazakhstan’s biggest overall trading partner, as the destination for 37% of total Kazakh exports and representing 27.9% of its total trade in 2023. The EU is also the biggest foreign investor in Kazakhstan, providing €54.8 billion of total foreign direct investment (FDI) stock in 2022: a 5.5% increase compared to 2021.Trade pictureIn 2023, the EU's trade in goods with Kazakhstan totalled €42.4 billion, a 5.6% increase on 2022. EU exports were worth €12.1 billion, a 17.2% increase on 2022, and imports from Kazakhstan reached €30.3 billion (up 1.6% vs. 2022). The trade balance in 2023 was €18.2 billion in favour of Kazakhstan, compared to €19.5 billion in favour of Kazakhstan in 2022.The EU's substantial trade deficit with Kazakhstan mainly results from Kazakhstan's oil and gas exports. Exports from Kazakhstan to the EU are dominated by mineral products (representing 91.5% of total Kazakh exports to the EU in 2023 – €27.7 billion). EU exports to Kazakhstan are more diverse: for example, machinery and transport equipment (52.9% of total EU exports in 2023), chemical products (16.1%), optical products (5.1%), metals (4%), plastics (3.9%), and textiles (3.2%).EU services exports to Kazakhstan stood at €2.1 billion in 2022, compared to €1.5 billion in 2021. Imports of services from Kazakhstan stood at €0.99 billion in 2021, vs. €0.7 billion in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and KazakhstanThe EPCA was signed in 2015 and began to be provisionally applied on 1 May 2016. After its ratification by all EU Member States, the agreement entered into force on 1 March 2020, replacing the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of 1999.The EPCA creates a better regulatory environment for businesses in areas such as:trade in services;establishment and operation of companies;capital movements;raw materials and energy;government procurement, and;intellectual property rights.The full implementation of the trade part of the EPCA is an important issue, which will facilitate foreign investment and diversification. There is room for improvement in trade flows in both directions: as regards Kazakhstan's exports to the EU, mineral products (oil, gas and uranium) are over-represented and represent roughly 90% of total exports. This lack of diversification makes Kazakh exports very volatile and exposed to the risk of sudden shocks.  As the EU and the world aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades, Kazakhstan needs to make the best possible use of the available time to reduce its dependence on fossil fuel exports. The EU is committed to cooperating with Kazakhstan in making this transition a success. In May 2023, the Commission received a mandate from the Council to negotiate a Protocol to the EPCA with Kazakhstan as regards the protection of Geographical Indications (GIs) for agricultural products and foodstuffs, wines and spirits.  On raw materials, on 7 November 2022, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Alikhan Smailov, prime minister of Kazakhstan, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Strategic Partnerships on Sustainable Raw Materials, Batteries, and Renewable Hydrogen Value Chains. The strategic partnership with Kazakhstan on raw materials is part of the EU's policy to ensure access to a secure, diversified, affordable and sustainable supply of critical raw materials.The MoU provides a political framework for enhanced cooperation in the current geopolitical context, while aiming to ensure the development of a secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials and refined materials vital for the green and digital transitions and for the decarbonisation of energy production. By aiming to develop renewable hydrogen and battery value chains, it will boost the green and digital transformation of both sides’ economies. A 2023-2024 roadmap setting out concrete action to achieve the MoU's goals has been agreed with Kazakhstan.On 17 June 2019, the Council adopted Conclusions on a new EU Strategy on Central Asia, which provides a framework for strengthening regional cooperation, and for addressing new opportunities and challenges in the region.The Strategy on Central Asia offers a broad basis for cooperation and has since been complemented by the Global Gateway Strategy and the European Green Deal, which are also relevant for the EU’s relations with the region. Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine and the ensuing challenge of preventing the circumvention of EU sanctions against Russia, while seeking even deeper and closer trade relations between the EU and Central Asian countries, will have to be handled in parallel.Kazakhstan and the WTOKazakhstan became the 162nd member of the WTO in 2015. The EU had consistently supported Kazakhstan’s accession.Cooperation CouncilHigh-level discussions on progress made in implementing the EPCA take place annually in the framework of the EU-Kazakhstan Cooperation Council. Its 20th meeting was held on 23 May 2023 in Astana.Technical dialogue on trade, investment and customs takes place regularly in the Cooperation Committee in Trade Configuration and in the Customs Sub-Committee.In addition, in summer 2019, a high-level EU-Kazakhstan Business Platform was launched in order to make possible direct dialogue between Kazakh authorities, business representatives and EU Heads of Mission.It brings to the attention of the Kazakh leadership concrete business climate difficulties, as well as opportunities (it helps to solve concrete cases, based on close cooperation with EU Member States and companies, in particular for addressing concerns shared by EU investors with regard to some taxation issues).Committees and DialoguesThe EU and Kazakhstan meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the Agreement.Technical committee meetings - agendas and reportsTrading with KazakhstanImporting into the EU from KazakhstanEU trade defence measures on imports from KazakhstanExporting from the EU to KazakhstanTrade defence measures in force in KazakhstanTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with KazakhstanKazakhstan is a member of the World Trade Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article14 May 2024EU tackles circumvention of anti-dumping tariffs on birch plywood importsToday, the European Commission has extended anti-dumping measures on imports of birch plywood from Russia to imports from Kazakhstan and Türkiye.1 min readAll the latest news on EU trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Facts, figures and latest developments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry or regionLebanonTrade topicsNegotiations and agreementsTrade policy\n\n\n\nLebanon signed an Association Agreement with the EU in June 2002, which entered into force in April 2006. As a result, Lebanese industrial as well as most agricultural products benefit from free access to the EU market.Trade pictureLebanon is the EU’s 61st biggest trade partner (2022).The EU is Lebanon’s biggest trade partner, accounting for 28.4% of its total trade in goods in 2022: 32% of Lebanon’s imports came from the EU and 12.4% of Lebanon’s exports went to the EU.Total trade in goods between the EU and Lebanon in 2022 amounted to €6.26 billion. The EU’s imports from Lebanon amounted to €0.6 billion and consisted mainly of crude materials (€0.2 billion, 33.8%), manufactured goods (€0.12 billion, 19.8%), and machinery and transport equipment (€0.12 billion, 12.2%). The EU’s exports to Lebanon were worth €5.66 billion and were dominated by fuel and mineral fuels (€2.82 billion, 50%), machinery and transport equipment (€0.61 billion, 10.9%), food and live animals (€0.58 billion, 10.2%) and chemicals (€0.56 billion, 9.9%).The Lebanese economy is based primarily on the service sector, which accounted for 76% of the country’s GDP in 2019, according to World Bank data. Two-way trade in services totalled €1.6 billion in 2021, with EU imports of services representing €0.6 billion and exports €1 billion. Construction, tourism, and financial services are the most prominent sectors among Lebanon's exports and imports of commercial services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and LebanonThe EU-Lebanon Association Agreement progressively liberalised trade in goods between the EU and Lebanon. It was implemented gradually between 2008 and 2014. Lebanese industrial and most agricultural products benefit from free access to the EU market, with a view to creating a bilateral Free Trade Area.In November 2010, the EU and Lebanon signed a protocol establishing a dispute settlement mechanism applicable to disputes under the trade provisions of the Association Agreement.The Free Trade Area (FTA) of the EU-Lebanon Association Agreement grants preferential treatment for Lebanese exports to the EU. In January 2014, the EU implemented changes to its Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP), which removes import duties from products coming into the EU from vulnerable developing countries. As a result, countries that already had preferential market access to the EU, like Lebanon due to its FTA, stopped benefiting from the GSP treatment in 2014.In 2021, under the new EU Trade Policy Review, the EU will propose a new sustainable investment initiative to partners in the Southern Neighbourhood and Africa interested in doing so. Fostering strategic interdependencies and enhancing EU’s relations and economic integration with the Southern Neighbourhood is a strategic necessity for long-term stability.Lebanon started to negotiate its accession to the WTO when the Working Party was established on 14 April 1999. The EU continues to support Lebanon’s efforts, as the negotiations are still ongoing.Lebanon's economy is characterised by a high level of imports and by substantial trade deficits. The deficits are largely offset by foreign income earnings, including capital inflows and remittances from the Lebanese diaspora, as well as the tourism, banking and insurance sectors.Financial supportThe European Neighbourhood Policy provides political and financial assistance to Lebanon. The EU committed €402.3 million to bilateral assistance for Lebanon for the period 2014-2020, under the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI). The funding supported cooperation priorities agreed with Lebanon, namely: (i) promoting growth and job creation; (ii) fostering local governance and socio-economic development, and; (iii) promoting the rule of law and enhancing security.Under the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2021-2027, the EU will adopt a broad new financial cooperation instrument: the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI). The NDICI will be the basis of future EU-Lebanon cooperation.More information on EU support is available from the Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations.Lebanon in the Southern NeighbourhoodLebanon is one of the partners of the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine*, Syria and Tunisia). The EU established its privileged partnership with the Eastern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean back in 1995 with the launch of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership at the Barcelona Conference, aiming to establish an area of peace, stability and economic prosperity that upholds democratic values and human rights.The 25th anniversary of the Barcelona Process in November 2020 was an opportunity to reflect on the strategic partnership with the region in light of the political, socioeconomic, financial and environmental challenges exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and to reassess the EU’s partnership with Lebanon and the other Southern Neighbourhood partner countries. Following consultations with partners, this reflection resulted in the Joint Communication by the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on ‘A renewed partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood - A new Agenda for the Mediterranean‘ and the annexed ’Economic and Investment Plan for the Southern Neighbours‘ in February 2021.More information on the Southern NeighbourhoodIn 2020, Lebanon (together with Palestine) joined the Agadir Agreement, which was originally established among Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia and entered into force in July 2006. The agreement committed all parties to removing all tariffs on trade between one another and to harmonising their legislation on standards and customs procedures. An Agadir Technical Unit in Amman ensures the implementation of the Agadir Agreement.More information on the Agadir AgreementThe impact of trade component of the EU’s Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Lebanon was assessed in the Ex-Post Evaluation of Trade Chapters of the Six Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements with the EU’s Southern Neighbours (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia), which was published by the European Commission in 2021.The pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation and the PEM Convention on rules of originThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation system of origin was created in 2005. It brings together the EU, Lebanon, and other partners in Europe and the Mediterranean to support regional integration by creating a common system of rules of origin. Rules of origin are  technical criteria which determine whether a specific product qualifies for duty-free or other preferential access under a given trade agreement.Cumulation of origin means that a product coming from one partner country can be processed or added to a product of a second partner country and still be considered as an ‘originating product’ of that second partner country for the purposes of a particular trade agreement.The pan-Euro-Mediterranean system allows for diagonal cumulation (i.e. cumulation between two or more countries) between the EU, EFTA countries, Turkey, the Western Balkans, the Faroe Islands, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and any country that signed the Barcelona Declaration of 1995. The system was originally based on a network of Free Trade Agreements with identical origin protocols.These individual origin protocols are being progressively replaced by a reference to the Regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin (PEM Convention), which was established in 2011 to provide a more unified framework for origin protocols. Lebanon signed the Regional Convention on 22 October 2014. The internal ratification process is ongoing.More information on Mediterranean preferential Rules of OriginTrading with LebanonImporting into the EU from LebanonEU trade defence measures on imports from LebanonExporting from the EU to LebanonTrade defence measures in force in LebanonTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with LebanonLebanon is a member of the World Trade Organization *This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpain - Spanish company finds beefy market in the Middle EastCecinas Nieto is a Spanish family business specialised in gourmet meat products.

Moldova's proportion of trade with Russia has fallen significantly and now represents only 3.7% of Moldova’s total trade. 65.4% of Moldovan exports are destined for the EU market.Moldova ranks 63rd among the EU's trading partners, with a total turnover of around €8.9 billion in 2023. The EU's exports to Moldova in 2024 amounted to €5.1 billion. Key EU exports are machinery and appliances, products from the chemical or related industries, and transport equipment. The EU's imports from Moldova remained stable compared to 2023, following a slight decrease (-7%) from the high levels achieved in 2022, representing €2.4 billion in 2024. The EU's main imports from Moldova are machinery and appliances, mineral products, and products from the chemical or related industries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and MoldovaEU-Moldova relations entered a new strategic phase when EU member states in the European Council granted Moldova the status of EU candidate country on 23 June 2022. On 14 December 2023, the Council decided to open accession negotiations with Moldova. In the meantime, EU-Moldova trade relations are determined by the free trade area set up by the DCFTA part of the Association Agreement.The DCFTA sets up a free-trade area between the EU and Moldova in line with the principles of the World Trade Organisation.The DCFTA allows for:The removal of import duties for most goods traded between the EU and MoldovaProvides for broad mutual access to trade in services for both partnersBoth EU and Moldovan companies can create a subsidiary or a branch office on a non-discriminatory basis. This means they receive the same treatment as domestic companies in the partner's market when setting up a business.An important part of the DCFTA is aligning Moldovan trade-related laws to selected EU legislative acts. The aim of Moldova's adoption of EU approaches to policy-making is to improve governance, strengthen the rule of law and provide more economic opportunities by widening the EU market to Moldovan goods and services.Temporary measures in support of Moldovan exports to the EUThe EU has adopted a regulation which provided temporary full trade liberalisation for Moldovan agricultural products for one year. The measures were first introduced in July 2022, and have been extended until 24 July 2025.    The regulation is just one of the measures adopted by the EU as part of its solidarity with the region in the context of the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine.More information: Monitoring data on imports from Moldova into the EU subject to trade liberalisation measuresMoldova and European Neighbourhood PolicyMoldova is a partner country of the Eastern Partnership within the European Neighbourhood Policy.

The last negotiating round was held in April 2014, after which negotiations were put on hold at Morocco’s request.An Amendment of the protocols of the EU-Morocco Association Agreement, which extended the tariff preferences laid down in the Association Agreement to products originating in Western Sahara, entered into force on 19 July 2019. In March 2024, the European Commission published its latest Staff Working Document on the implementation of the agreement. The report demonstrated that the agreement is being implemented smoothly and that it is delivering benefits for Western Sahara and its population in terms of exports, economic activity and employment.In 2021, under the new EU Trade Policy Review, the EU has offered to discuss modernising trade and investment relations with Morocco, to better adapt them to today’s challenges. The impact of the trade component of the EU's Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Morocco was assessed by the ex-post evaluation of the trade chapters of the six Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia), which was published by the European Commission in 2021.  Financial supportUnder the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2021-2027, the EU adopted a broad new financial cooperation instrument: the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument – Global Europe (NDICI-GE). The NDICI is the basis of EU-Morocco cooperation. The EU committed €931 million to bilateral assistance for Morocco for the period 2021-2024, under the NDICI-GE).  Morocco is one of the largest recipients of EU funds under the European Neighbourhood Policy. More information on EU support is available from the Directorate-General for Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf (DG MENA).Morocco in the Southern NeighbourhoodThe EU established its privileged partnership with the Eastern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean back in 1995 with the launch of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership at the Barcelona Conference, aiming to establish an area of peace, stability and economic prosperity that upholds democratic values and human rights.The 25th anniversary of the Barcelona Process in November 2020 was an opportunity to reflect on the strategic partnership with the region in light of the political, socioeconomic, financial and environmental challenges exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and to reassess the EU’s partnership with Morocco and the other Southern Neighbourhood partner countries. Following consultations with partners, this reflection resulted in a Joint Communication by the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on ‘A renewed partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood – A new Agenda for the Mediterranean’ and the annexed ‘Economic and Investment Plan for the Southern Neighbours’ in February 2021.More information on the Southern NeighbourhoodIn addition to the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, in 2004 Morocco signed the Agadir Agreement with Jordan, Egypt and Tunisia. The agreement committed all parties to removing all tariffs on trade between them and to harmonise their legislation with regard to standards and customs procedures. The Agadir Agreement entered into force in July 2006, and an Agadir Technical Unit in Amman ensures its implementation. Lebanon and Palestine joined the agreement in 2020.The pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation and the PEM Convention on rules of originThe pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation system of origin was created in 2005. It brings together the EU, Morocco, and other partners in Europe and the Mediterranean to support regional integration by creating a common system of rules of origin. Rules of origin are technical criteria which determine whether a specific product qualifies for duty-free or other preferential access under a given trade agreement.Cumulation of origin means a product coming from one partner country can be processed or added to a product of a second partner country and still be considered an ‘originating product’ of that second partner country for the purposes of a particular trade agreement.The pan-Euro-Mediterranean system allows for diagonal cumulation (i.e. cumulation between two or more countries) between the EU, EFTA countries, Türkiye, the Western Balkans, the Faroe Islands, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and any country that signed the Barcelona Declaration of 1995. The system was originally based on a network of Free Trade Agreements with identical origin protocols.These individual origin protocols are being progressively replaced by a reference to the Regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin (PEM Convention), which was established in 2011 to provide a more unified framework for origin protocols. Morocco acceded to the Regional Convention on 18 April 2012.Committees and DialoguesThe EU and Morocco meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the Agreement.Technical committee meetings - agendas and reportsTrading with MoroccoImporting into the EU from MoroccoEU trade defence measures on imports from MoroccoExporting from the EU to MoroccoTrade defence measures in force in MoroccoTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with MoroccoMorocco is a member of the World Trade Organization* This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article14 March 2025Commission imposes duties on unfairly subsidised imports of aluminium road wheels from MoroccoThe European Commission has imposed countervailing duties on imports of aluminium road wheels from Morocco, shielding EU producers and defending 16,600 jobs from unfair trading practices.1 min readNews article12 January 2023EU confirms duties on dumped imports of aluminium road wheels from MoroccoThe Commission today imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of aluminium road wheels originating in Morocco.

In 2018, the EU entered into enhanced engagement under EBA with Myanmar, in view of assessing compliance with human rights and labour rights conventions.After the military coup on 1 February 2021, the EU has reassessed its engagement towards Myanmar and its response, based on the Council Conclusions of 22 February 2021.Trade pictureTotal trade between the EU and Myanmar amounted to €3.7 billion in 2023.In 2023, the EU ranked as Myanmar's third-biggest trade partner (after China at 26.4% and Thailand at 17.2), accounting for 11.1% of the country’s total trade. Myanmar was the EU’s 57th largest trading partner (accounting for 0.1% of the EU’s total trade). In 2023, the EU imported goods worth €3.4 billion from Myanmar. The key EU imports from Myanmar are dominated by garments and footwear. Other imports include manufactured goods and agricultural products. In 2023, the EU exported goods worth €324 million to Myanmar. The key EU exports to Myanmar are dominated by chemicals, foodstuffs, machinery, and transport equipment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and MyanmarThe EU and Myanmar launched negotiations for an investment protection agreement in 2014, which were since then put on hold.The agreement would:offer investors from both sides a predictable and secure investment environmentprotect them against discriminationensure they are treated in a fair and equitable way andensure that investments will not be unfairly taken away without fair compensation.A sustainability impact assessment complemented the negotiations. This evaluated the potential economic, social, environmental, and human rights impact of the future agreement.The EU is committed to the conclusion of an ambitious investment protection agreement that will allow investors to benefit from the enhanced legal certainty and promote responsible investments from the EU to contribute to Myanmar's sustainable development. The negotiations were put on hold in 2017 as negotiations cannot happen in isolation of the broader context, in particular the EU’s serious concerns on human rights.As a Least Developed Country (LDC), Myanmar benefits from the most favourable regime available under the EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP), namely the Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme.The EU’s GSP regulation allows vulnerable developing countries to pay fewer or no duties on exports to the EU, giving them vital access to the EU market and contributing to their growth. The EBA scheme is one arm of the GSP, which grants duty-free and quota-free access to the EU for all products (except arms and ammunition) for the world's Least Developed Countries, as defined by the United Nations.Myanmar benefits significantly from its preferential access to the EU market under the EBA. Main exports to the EU are textiles, footwear, rice and precious stones.Out of the total exports in 2020, about 98% were eligible to EBA preferential duties.The GSP Regulation provides that trade preferences may be suspended in case of \"serious and systematic violation of principles\" laid down in the human rights and labour rights Conventions listed in Annex VIII of the Regulation.Myanmar and ASEANMyanmar is one of the ten member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and one of its three LDCs.More information on ASEANTrading with MyanmarImporting into the EU from MyanmarEU trade defence measures on imports from MyanmarExporting from the EU to MyanmarTrade defence measures in force in MyanmarTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with MyanmarMyanmar is a member of the World Trade Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The deficit in the trade of goods is mostly due to a shift in the import of gas away from Russia. 67.5% of Norwegian exports go to the EU.Exports from the EU to Norway are dominated by machinery and appliances, as well as transport equipment, while mineral products represent around 53% of EU imports from Norway.  Norway is the biggest exporter of fish and aquaculture products to the EU.The balance of trade in services between Norway and the EU is positive for the EU and rather stable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and NorwayAs a member state of the European Economic Area, Norway fully applies the whole EU acquis communautaire relevant to the four freedoms (free movement of goods, persons, services and capital), along with that pertinent to flanking policies (i.e. transport, competition, social policy, consumer protection, environment, statistics and company law).As a result, the EEA agreement provides for a high degree of economic integration, common competition rules, rules for state aid and government procurement.Agriculture and fisheries are not covered by the EEA agreement. However, Article 19 thereof highlights the commitment of the parties to progressive liberalisation of agricultural trade, which is achieved through the conclusion of separate agreements on that basis. The latest agreement under this article dates from 2018.As a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), Norway seeks to conclude bilateral Free Trade Agreements in the so-called EFTA framework. This means that Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein can negotiate a Free Trade Agreement with a respective third country via EFTA.Trading with NorwayImporting into the EU from NorwayEU trade defence measures on imports from NorwayExporting from the EU to NorwayTrade defence measures in force in NorwayTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with NorwayNorway is a member of the World Trade Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Enhancing bilateral trade and investment is also part of the EU-Pakistan 5-year Engagement Plan from 2012.Pakistan is a major beneficiary of the trading opportunities offered by the EU Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP). From 1 January 2014, Pakistan benefits from generous tariff preferences (mostly zero duties on two thirds of all product categories) under the so-called GSP+ arrangement aiming to support sustainable development and good governance. In order to maintain GSP+, Pakistan has to keep ratification and effectively implement 27 core international conventions on human and labour rights, environmental protection, and good governance.Trade pictureThe EU is Pakistan's second most important trading partner, accounting for 15.3% of Pakistan's total trade in 2023.In 2023, Pakistan was the EU's 47th largest trading partner in goods, accounting for 0.2% of EU trade.Pakistani exports to the EU are dominated by textiles and clothing, accounting for 73.2% of Pakistan's total exports to the EU in 2023.Pakistan's imports from the EU are mainly comprised of machinery and transport equipment (23.9% in 2023) as well as chemicals (19.8% in 2023).Pakistan is the largest beneficiary of the EU's GSP+ arrangement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and PakistanThe EU and Pakistan have set up a Sub-Group on Trade to promote the development of two-way trade. The Sub-Group on Trade, set up under the auspices of the EU-Pakistan Joint Commission, is the forum for discussions on trade policy developments more broadly. It also aims to tackle individual market access issues which hamper trade between the two parties.While Pakistan's economy holds considerable potential, high costs of doing business, complex regulation and infrastructure bottlenecks all have a detrimental effect on trade and growth. Pakistan's trade regime and regulatory environment still remain comparatively restrictive.Textiles and clothing account for over 80% of Pakistan's exports to the EU. While the textiles and clothing industry are the backbone of Pakistani exports, relying so heavily on one product category carries risks for Pakistan. Trade diversification would play an essential role in this respect. The granting of GSP+ preferences in 2014 should stimulate Pakistan's efforts towards diversification.As a result of GSP+, more than 78% of Pakistan's exports enter the EU at preferential rates.Around 80% of the textiles and clothing articles imported to the EU from Pakistan enter the EU at a preferential tariff rate. Around a quarter of these imports are bed linen, table linen and toilet and kitchen linen.Pakistan's trade preferencesThe EU supports Pakistan's integration into the world economy and its sustainable economic development by granting it GSP+ trade preferences.Thanks to GSP+ more than 76% of Pakistan's exports, including textiles and clothing, enter the EU duty and quota free. This represents almost 20% of Pakistan's exports globally. The GSP+ preferences should also help Pakistan diversify its export basket.In order to maintain GSP+ Pakistan has to keep ratification and effectively implement 27 core international conventions on human and labour rights, environmental protection and good governance. This is closely monitored by the European Commission and also under a permanent scrutiny by the EU Member States and European Parliament, as well as civil society.Trading with PakistanImporting into the EU from PakistanEU trade defence measures on imports from PakistanExporting from the EU to PakistanTrade defence measures in force in PakistanTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with PakistanPakistan is a member of the World Trade Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The second round of negotiations between the EU and the Philippines took place in February 2017, but the talks were then put on hold. In July 2023, the EU and the Philippines announced their intention to begin an extensive technical stocktaking exercise with a view to assess if conditions were right for potentially resuming negotiations on a free trade agreement (FTA).\nThe EU and the Philippines announced the resumption of negotiations for a comprehensive and modern FTA in March 2024.\n\nThe Philippines is a member of the WTO since 1995.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEU-Philippines agreementEU-Philippines Free Trade AgreementBeing negotiated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade pictureTotal trade in goods between the EU and the Philippines amounted to €16.1 billion in 2023. In 2023, the EU was the Philippines’ fourth-largest trading partner, accounting for 8.1% of the country’s total trade (after China at 20.3%, Japan at 10.5%, and the United States at 9.9%). The Philippines was the EU's 42nd largest trading partner globally, accounting for 0.3% of the EU’s total trade.  EU exports to the Philippines are dominated by machinery, transport equipment, chemicals, and food products, while the Philippines' main exports to the EU are office and telecommunications equipment, machinery, food products, and optical and photographic instruments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and the PhilippinesSince December 2014, the Philippines enjoys enhanced trade preferences with the EU under the EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences plus (GSP+). The special incentive arrangement for Sustainable Development and Good Governance GSP+ grants full removal of tariffs on two thirds of all product categories, aiming to support sustainable development and good governance.In order to maintain GSP+, the Philippines is subject to a regular monitoring of its obligation to the effective implementation of 27 core international conventions on human and labour rights, environmental protection and good governance.A Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) has been carried out in support of FTA negotiations between the EU and the Philippines. The SIA seeks to assess how trade and trade-related provisions in a future FTA could potentially impact economic, social, human rights and environmental elements in each trading partner and in other relevant countries.More on the EU-Philippines SIAThe Philippines and ASEANThe Philippines is one of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the fifth largest economy in the region in terms of GDP and the EU’s 7th largest trading partner in ASEAN. The countries as a group are the EU's third largest trading partner outside Europe, after the US and China.The ASEAN region is a dynamic market with some 640 million consumers and with a population of over 100 million, the Philippines is the second biggest market in ASEAN.The EU co-operates closely with ASEAN as a whole. Co-operation is maintained through the EU-ASEAN Dialogue, which includes discussions on trade and investment issues at ministerial and senior economic official level.Ensuring better access for EU exporters to the dynamic ASEAN market is a priority for the EU. Negotiations for a region-to-region trade and investment agreement between the EU and ASEAN were launched in 2007 and paused by mutual agreement in 2009 to give way to a bilateral format of negotiations.These bilateral trade and investment agreements were conceived as building blocks towards a future region-to-region agreement.More information on ASEANCommittees and DialoguesThe EU and Philippines meet regularly to discuss various issues, including trade relations.Technical committee meetings - agendas and reportsTrading with PhilippinesImporting into the EU from PhilippinesEU trade defence measures on imports from PhilippinesExporting from the EU to PhilippinesTrade defence measures in force in PhilippinesTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with PhilippinesPhilippines is a member of the World Trade Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsPress release18 March 2024EU and the Philippines announce resumption of negotiations for a free trade agreementToday, the EU and the Philippines officially announced the resumption of negotiations for an ambitious, modern and balanced free trade agreement (FTA) – with sustainability at its core. 1 min readAll the latest news on EU trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

After the European Parliament gave its consent to the two agreements on 13 February 2019, the EUSFTA entered into force on 21 November 2019. The EUSIPA will enter into force once it has been ratified by all EU Member States. On 25 July 2024, the EU and Singapore concluded negotiations for a digital trade agreement (EUSDTA). Both parties are currently following their respective procedures towards the formal signature and conclusion of the EUSDTA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEU-Singapore agreementsEU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement | Investment Protection Agreement | Digital Trade AgreementIn place | Being adopted or ratified | Being adopted or ratified\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade pictureIn 2022, Singapore was the EU's 11th largest trading partner worldwide and the largest trading partner in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). Total trade in goods and services accounted for €130 billion, with a sizeable positive balance of €6.3 billion.  With a total value of €77.6 billion, Singapore was the EU’s fifth-largest trading partner for trade in services in 2022. In 2023, Singapore was the EU’s 20th biggest trading partner for trade in goods, with a total value of €52.6 billion. Singapore is a major destination for European investments in Asia, and the second-largest Asian investor in the EU (after Japan).In 2022, the bilateral foreign direct investment stock between the EU and Singapore was roughly €434 billion, having expanded rapidly in the preceding years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and SingaporeNegotiations for a comprehensive bilateral trade and investment agreement with Singapore began in 2010 and were completed in 2017. The negotiations resulted in a Free Trade Agreement (EUSFTA) and an Investment Protection Agreement (EUSIPA). Key elements of the EUSFTA include the elimination of all remaining tariffs on products while opening new opportunities for service providers in sectors like telecommunications, environmental services, engineering, computing, and maritime transport. The EUSFTA includes ambitious provisions in the field of government procurement, intellectual property (including Geographical Indications), sanitary and phytosanitary measures, customs, rules of origin, renewable energies, and sustainable development. The EUSIPA ensures high levels of investment protection, while allowing the EU and Singapore to regulate public policy objectives like health, safety, and the environment. It creates a modern framework for private and public investments and introduces a balanced Investment Court System for resolving investment disputes. Both agreements were signed on 19 October 2019, making them the first of their kind to have been concluded between the EU and a Southeast Asian country.In July 2023, the EU and Singapore decided to bring their long-standing and robust economic partnership into the digital domain by launching negotiations on a digital trade agreement (EUSDTA). The agreement aims to build consumer trust, ensure predictability and legal certainty for businesses, and remove and prevent the emergence of unjustified barriers to digital trade. It also ensures that the EU and Singapore preserve policy space to develop and implement the policies required to address new challenges in the digital economy. Negotiations on the EUSDTA were concluded on 25 July 2024.Together, the EU's three bilateral agreements with Singapore represent important milestones towards greater engagement between the EU and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).Committees and DialoguesThe EU and Singapore meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the Agreement.Technical committee meetings - agendas and reportsTrading with SingaporeImporting into the EU from SingaporeEU trade defence measures on imports from SingaporeExporting from the EU to SingaporeTrade defence measures in force in SingaporeTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with SingaporeSingapore is a member of the World Trade OrganizationSustainable impact assessment of the EU-ASEAN Countries Free Trade Agreement (FTA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExporters' stories\nAustria - Austrian engineering puts solar panels on Singapore's rooftopsThe Austrian company's reputation for quality and engineering has allowed them to expand abroad.

The agreement provisionally entered into force on 10 October 2016.Under the EU-SADC EPA, the EU fully or partially removed customs duties on 97.8% of imports from South Africa in 2022, while guaranteeing full free access for the rest of the signatory countries. Until the application of the EU-SADC EPA, trade relations between the EU and South Africa had been governed by the trade chapter of the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) concluded in 1999. The trade-related provisions of the TDCA were replaced by the EU-SADC EPA.Trade pictureEU-South Africa trade and investment has been increasing steadily since the EU-SADC EPA began to be applied. Since 2016, EU-South Africa trade has increased by 42% (EU imports have risen by 65% and EU exports have gone up by 26%). South Africa is the EU's biggest trading partner in Sub-Saharan Africa, with €49.5 billion of total trade in goods in 2023.The EU is the largest source of foreign direct investment in South Africa – almost half of South Africa's FDI stocks originate in the EU. The automotive sector provides an example of successful diversification of South African exports and the creation of value chains with high-value addition in South Africa. Between 2016 and 2023, the EU’s automotive imports from South Africa increased by 64% and its automotive exports went up by 15%. Trade in the automotive sector reached €11 billion in 2023, accounting for 22% of overall trade. South Africa's primary exports to the EU are machinery and transport equipment, fuels and mining products, and precious metals and articles. EU exports to South Africa are dominated by machinery and appliances, transport equipment, and chemicals and allied industries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and South AfricaAmong other benefits, the EU-SADC EPA provides South Africa with improved market access to the EU, more flexible rules of origin, and more effective safeguards.The EPA contributes to improving the business climate between its partners by providing companies with a stable and forward-looking framework, in South Africa and across the Southern African region. It helps to boost bilateral and regional trade, thereby providing new opportunities to fulfil the objectives of the South Africa-EU Strategic Partnership.EU-based companies invest in a wide range of economic activities in South Africa and are major contributors to the country’s industrialisation and transformation agenda.Following the termination of most Bilateral Investment Treaties with EU countries, South Africa adopted a Protection of Investment Act in 2015. The EU Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Southern Africa, established in 2015, provides a coherent approach on issues of concern to European businesses investing in the region.Trading with South AfricaImporting into the EU from South AfricaEU trade defence measures on imports from South AfricaExporting from the EU to South AfricaTrade defence measures in force in South AfricaTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with South AfricaFactsheet on the EU-South Africa Strategic PartnershipSouth Africa is a member of the World Trade OrganizationDG Trade webpage on the Southern African Development Community (SADC)DG Trade webpage on Economic Partnership AgreementsSustainable impact assessment of the EU-African Caribbean Pacific Trade Relations of the Economic Partnership Agreements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGermany - EU trade deal gives German firm a liftThe 2000 EU-South Africa trade deal has enabled a small manufacturer of industrial lifting equipment from south-west Germany to take advantage of new export opportunities and hire workers.

The FTA was the EU’s first with an Asian country and the first to include a chapter on trade and sustainable development.To complement the FTA, the EU and the Republic of Korea launched negotiations for a digital trade agreement on 31 October 2023, building on the EU-Republic of Korea Digital Trade Principles agreed in 2022. The two sides intend to agree on a set of ambitious, modern digital trade rules, building on and complementing the existing preferential trade framework.  *Covering the territory of the Republic of Korea, commonly known as South Korea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEU-South Korea agreementsEU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement | Digital Trade Agreement In place | Being negotiated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade pictureThe Republic of Korea is the EU's 8th largest trade partner in goods, whereas the EU is Korea's 3rd largest trade partner in goods.Since the entry into force of the FTA on 1 July 2011, bilateral trade and investment have expanded remarkably. Total bilateral trade in goods amounted to ca. €130 billion in 2023, up by 106% from 2011 (ca. €63 billion).Bilateral trade in goods remains highly concentrated on industrial products, which represented 96% of such trade in 2023, including machinery and mechanical appliances (32%), transportation equipment (21%), and chemical products (18%).Bilateral trade in agricultural and fishery products has gradually increased, accounting for just below 4% in 2023. Of EU exports to Korea, the share of agricultural and fishery products is at just below 9% in 2023.Bilateral trade in services increased by 63% between 2012 and 2022, amounting to ca. €31 billion in 2022 (latest available data). In 2022, trade in services remained concentrated on several services including transport (41%); other business services (19%); as well as telecommunications, computer and information services (11%).The EU remains the Republic of Korea's biggest foreign direct investor, with an FDI stock of €54 billion (2022), ahead of Japan and the United States. Among EU Member States, the Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg are the largest investors in 2022, with financial, insurance and other professional services attracting significant investments. Korean investments into the EU have also grown and reached €40.6 billion in 2022: about ¾ of the volume of EU outward stocks. Korean investments are particularly focused on the electric vehicles sector, with Hungary, Poland and Germany being the largest investment destinations in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and the Republic of KoreaThe Republic of Korea is one of the most dynamic economies in the world, with a GDP of about €1.5 trillion. It ranks as the 13th largest economy in the world and the 4th largest economy in Asia. Additionally, the Republic of Korea is a highly successful economy at the technological forefront, spending 4.9% of its GDP on R&D, ahead of the EU at 2.3%. This is reflected in the country’s industrial strengths, which include high-tech and R&D intensive products such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, consumer electronics,  and the shipbuilding and automotive sectors, including EV batteries.In 2023, the Republic of Korea’s bilateral trade in goods with the EU reached ca. €130 billion, up by 106% from 2011 when the FTA was first applied. The FTA removed the majority of import duties in 2011, with those remaining removed after five years on 1 July 2016 – with the exception of duties on a limited number of agricultural products. The agreement also addresses non-tariff barriers to trade, specifically in the automotive, pharmaceutical, medical devices and electronics sectors. The FTA has also created new opportunities for market access in services and investments, and includes provisions in areas such as competition policy, government procurement, intellectual property rights, and transparency in regulation.Regarding the implementation of the FTA, progress has been made with regard to the Republic of Korea’s recognition of the EU’s regionalisation measures to control outbreaks of African swine fever and the highly pathogenic avian influenza in 2022. Additionally, and following continuous engagement between the EU, Member States, and the Republic of Korea, the Korean government abolished local content requirements in the offshore wind energy sector, which had allowed for higher prices for windfarms that have a minimum of 50% domestic components. Meanwhile, the EU continues to closely follow developments in the sector advocating for predictability and transparency of the permission process and auction rounds.More on the implementation of the FTAThe Commission's annual reports on the implementation of FTAs contain a section on the Republic of Korea.Factsheet: EU-Korea FTA: a quick reading guideFactsheet: 10 key benefits of the EU-Korea FTAThe FTA is also the first such agreement of the EU that includes a chapter on trade and sustainable development (TSD). The chapter reaffirms the commitment of both parties to contribute to sustainable development, with binding provisions upholding and promoting social and environmental standards. Following the activation of the bilateral dispute resolution mechanism under this chapter, the Republic of Korea is in the process of amending its labour laws in the context of ratifying International Labour Organisation Conventions.More on sustainable development (including dispute settlement) in the EU-Korea FTATo complement the FTA, the EU and the Republic of Korea launched negotiations for a Digital Trade Agreement on 31 October 2023, building on the EU-Republic of Korea Digital Trade Principles agreed in 2022. The two sides intend to agree on a set of ambitious, modern digital trade rules, building on and complementing the existing preferential trade framework.Beyond trade, in 2010, the EU and the Republic of Korea upgraded their broader relationship to a Strategic Partnership. On 10 May 2010 the two sides signed a Framework Agreement, which entered into force on 1 June 2014. The agreement provides a basis for strengthened cooperation on major political and global issues such as human rights, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, counter-terrorism, climate change, and energy security.Committees and DialoguesTo ensure full implementation, the FTA established a number of specialised committees and working groups between the two parties. These bodies also provide an opportunity to seek resolutions to market access concerns and to engage in closer regulatory cooperation. They report to the annual Trade Committee between the EU and the Republic of Korea at ministerial level, which ensures the FTA’s proper operation.Technical committee meetings - agendas and reportsTrading with the Republic of KoreaImporting into the EU from KoreaEU trade defence measures on imports from KoreaExporting from the EU to KoreaTrade defence measures in force in KoreaTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with the Republic of KoreaThe Republic of Korea is a member of the World Trade OrganizationEvaluation of the Free Trade Agreement between the EU and the Republic of Korea\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExporters' stories\nAustria - Exports help Austrian climbing equipment maker reach the summitThe 2011 EU-South Korea trade deal eliminated customs duties enabling AustiAlpin, a climbing equipment maker, to start doing business there.

Angola has an option to join the agreement in future.The agreement became the first regional EPA in Africa to be fully operational after Mozambique started applying the EPA in February 2018.Southern African Development Community EPA countries: Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, EswatiniThe other six members of the Southern African Development Community region – the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Zambia and Zimbabwe – are negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements with the EU as part of other regional groups, namely Central Africa or Eastern and Southern Africa.More information on the EU-SADC EPAPublished text of the agreement and annexesOn 22 June 2021, the EU started negotiations with Angola on a Sustainable Investment Facilitation Agreement.Trade pictureThe EU is the Southern African Development Community EPA Group's largest trading partner, with South Africa accounting for the largest part of EU imports to and EU exports from the region.The Southern African Development Community EPA countries are strong in the exports of diamonds and in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho and Namibia these constitute a large to dominant share of their exports to the EU.Other products from the region include agricultural products (beef from Botswana, fish from Namibia or sugar from Eswatini), oil from Angola or aluminum from Mozambique. South Africa's exports to the EU are much diversified and range from fruit to platinum and from manufactured goods to wine.The EU exports a wide range of goods to the Southern African Development Community EPA countries, including vehicles, machinery, electrical equipment, pharmaceuticals and processed food.The countries in the Southern African Development Community EPA Group are members of the WTO.The SADC EPA group are very diverse in terms of economic development: Lesotho and Mozambique are least developed countries (LDCs), but Namibia and Botswana hold upper middle income status. Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia South Africa and Eswatini form the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and the Southern African Development CommunityDevelopment-orientedThe EPA gives asymmetric access to the partners in the SADC EPA group. They can shield sensitive products from full liberalisation and safeguards can be deployed when imports from the EU are growing too quickly. A detailed development chapter identifies trade-related areas that can benefit from funding. The agreement also contains a chapter on sustainable development which covers social and environmental matters.Improved opportunities for trade in goodsThe EPA guarantees access to the EU market without any duties or quotas for Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, and Eswatini. South Africa benefits from new market access in comparison to the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and South Africa (TDCA), whichthat currently governeds the trade relations with the EU until October 2016 (when the EPA entered into provisional application and thereby repealed the trade component of the TDCA). The new access includes better trading terms mainly in agriculture and fisheries, including for wine, sugar, fisheries products, flowers and canned fruits. The EU will obtain meaningful new market access into the Southern African Customs Union (products include wheat, barley, cheese, meat products and butter), and will have the security of a bilateral agreement with Mozambique, one of the LDCs in the region.Geographical indicationsThe EPA includes a bilateral protocol between the EU and South Africa on the protection of geographical indications and on trade in wines and spirits.

Negotiations to create Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTAs) have been launched between the EU and Morocco, and between the EU and Tunisia.In 2021, under the new EU Trade Policy Review, the EU has announced a new sustainable investment initiative for interested partners in the Southern Neighbourhood and Africa.Southern Neighbourhood: Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine*, Syria, TunisiaTrade pictureIn 2023, the region represented 4.9% of total EU external trade.Total trade in goods between the EU and the Southern Neighbourhood countries amounted to €247.3 billion in 2023.The EU’s imports were worth €123.9 billion in 2023, whereas its exports totalled €123.4 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and the Southern NeighbourhoodThe EU established its privileged partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood in 1995 with the launch of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership at the Barcelona Conference, aiming to establish an area of peace, stability, economic prosperity, upholding democratic values and human rights.As a continuation of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, the Union for the Mediterranean was launched in 2008. This inter-governmental partnership promotes cooperation and dialogue in the Euro-Mediterranean region and brings together all 27 EU Member States and 16 countries of the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean (Albania, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Mauritania, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, North Macedonia, Palestine*, Syria – suspended, Tunisia and Türkiye. Libya is an observer. Since 2012, the EU and Jordan hold the joint presidency of the Union for the Mediterranean.Trade relations between the EU and its Southern Neighbours are managed at the bilateral level through the free trade areas established under the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements and essentially cover trade in goods. Nearly all countries have concluded Association Agreements with the EU, except for Libya and Syria.CountryStatusDate signedEntry into ForceReferenceAlgeriaSignedApril 2002September 2005OJ L 265EgyptSignedJune 2001June 2004OJ L 304IsraelSignedNov 1995June 2000OJ L 147JordanSignedNov 1997May 2002OJ L 129/02LebanonSignedJune 2002April 2006OJ L 143/06MoroccoSignedFeb 1996March 2000OJ L 70/00PalestineSignedFeb 1997Interim Agreement July 1997OJ L 187/97SyriaInitialled (December 2008)   TunisiaSignedJuly 1995March 1998OJ L 97/98On 10 November 2020, the trade ministers of the Union for the Mediterranean convened for the 11th Trade Ministerial Conference. In their joint statement they called for the strengthening of trade ties as a crucial element for regional economic recovery, and launched three new initiatives to further facilitate and increase trade and investment flows.The 25th anniversary of the Barcelona Process in November 2020 was an opportunity to reflect on the EU’s strategic partnership with its Southern Neighbourhood in light of the political, socioeconomic, financial and environmental challenges exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and to reassess the EU’s partnership with the region. This reflection resulted in a Joint Communication by the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on ‘A renewed partnership with the Southern Neighbourhood – A new Agenda for the Mediterranean’ and the annexed ‘Economic and Investment Plan for the Southern Neighbours’ in February 2021.Also in February 2021, under the new EU Trade Policy Review, the EU announced a new sustainable investment initiative for interested partners in the Southern Neighbourhood and Africa.Deepening economic integration between the Southern Neighbours is an essential factor for the socio-economic development of the region. In 2004, Egypt Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia signed the Agadir Agreement. The agreement committed signatory parties to removing all tariffs on trade between one another, and to harmonise their legislation on standards and customs procedures. The Agadir Agreement entered into force in July 2006, and an Agadir Technical Unit in Amman ensures its implementation. Lebanon and Palestine joined the Agreement in 2020.However, the regional economic integration between Southern Mediterranean countries is still limited: intra-regional trade is a small fraction of the countries’ total trade, representing one of the lowest levels of regional economic integration in the world.More information on the cooperation with the Southern NeighbourhoodIn 2021, the European Commission published the Ex-Post Evaluation of Trade Chapters of the Six Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements with the EU’s Southern Neighbours: Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia. The evaluation’s main objective was to assess the effects of trade chapters and propose recommendations for further enhancing economic integration in the Euro-Mediterranean area.Committees and DialoguesThe EU and the Southern Neighbourhood meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the agreement.Algeria - Meetings and documentsEgypt - Meetings and documentsJordan - Meetings and documentsPalestine - Meetings and documentsTrading with the Southern NeighbourhoodImporting into the EU from the Southern NeighbourhoodEU trade defence measures on imports from the Southern NeighbourhoodExporting from the EU to the Southern NeighbourhoodTrade defence measures in force in the Southern NeighbourhoodTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine*, Syria, TunisiaThe Union for the Mediterranean.Sustainability impact assessment for the Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area (EMFTA)* This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In 2023, our bilateral trade in goods reached €327 billion, accounting for 6.4% of the EU’s total trade in goods.Swiss merchandise exports to the EU are concentrated in a few sectors, particularly chemicals/pharma and medical products (€65.3 billion, 45.4%), machinery and appliances (€18.4 billion, 13.2%), optical and photographic instruments (€14.5 billion, 10.4%), and pearls and precious metals (€12.2 billion, 8.8%).Switzerland is a very important partner of the EU for trade in services, in particular for commercial services. In 2023, total bilateral trade in services reached €245 billion.  Both the EU and Switzerland are among each other's top destinations for foreign investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and SwitzerlandRelations between the EU and Switzerland are governed by a series of bilateral agreements. The cornerstone of EU-Swiss trade relations is the Free Trade Agreement of 1972.As a consequence of the rejection by Switzerland of membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) in 1992, Switzerland and the EU agreed on a package of seven sectoral agreements signed in 1999 (known in Switzerland as 'Bilaterals I'). Some of these are relevant from a trade perspective:The Free Movement of Persons Agreement allows for the provision of services, limited in time.The Mutual Recognition Agreement in relation to conformity assessment ensures that, in twenty regulated sectors, the conformity assessment provided by one party is recognised by the other, which facilitates trade between the parties. The Public Procurement Agreement builds on the WTO Government Procurement Agreement.The Agreement on trade in agricultural products includes sanitary and phytosanitary rules, as well as tariffs and tariff rate quotas for agricultural products, except for cheese that is fully liberalised.A Protocol on processed agricultural products (Protocol 2), which was added to the Free Trade Agreement in 2005. It includes a mechanism whereby in practice Switzerland receives compensation for the very significant price differential of basic agricultural products – which serve as inputs to processed agricultural products – between the EU and Switzerland. A further set of sectoral agreements was signed in 2004 (known as 'Bilaterals II'), covering, inter alia, Switzerland's participation in the Schengen area and Dublin asylum system, and agreements on taxation of savings, processed agricultural products, statistics, combating fraud, participation in the EU Media Programme and the European Environment Agency.In their first decade of existence, the EU became aware of various structural problems with the bilateral agreements. In 2014, the EU and Switzerland therefore set out to negotiate an Institutional Framework Agreement (IFA) intended to provide solutions for all existing and future internal market access agreements. The IFA aimed to restructure EU-Swiss trade relations, notably by providing crucial rules and procedures for the dynamic takeover and homogenous application of internal market law, for enforcement of state aid rules, and dispute settlement.Following the breakdown of the negotiations on the Institutional Framework Agreement in May 2021, the EU’s aim has been to find a systemic solution to the structural governance issues based on the principle of non-discrimination between citizens and a level playing field between companies.In November 2023, after 18 months of exploratory talks, the Commission and the Swiss authorities reached a Common Understanding on a broad package of measures to address the structural issues across the various agreements covered by the IFA, as well as any other internal market-related agreements that the EU and Switzerland may negotiate in future. Based on this package, both the Swiss Federal Council and the Council of the European Union adopted negotiating directives in March 2024. The formal negotiation process on this new package was launched on 18 March 2024 and completed on 20 December 2024. Over 200 negotiating meetings were held to reach an agreement. The completion of the negotiations marks the opening of the signature and ratification process in the EU and in Switzerland.Committees and DialoguesThe EU and Switzerland meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the Agreement.Technical committee meetings - agendas and reportsTrading with SwitzerlandImporting into the EU from SwitzerlandEU trade defence measures on imports from SwitzerlandExporting from the EU to SwitzerlandTrade defence measures in force in SwitzerlandTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with SwitzerlandSwitzerland is a member of the World Trade Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article30 April 2020Interim appeal arrangement for WTO disputes becomes effective Today, the EU and other WTO members have formally notified the ‘Multi-party interim appeal arbitration arrangement’ (MPIA) to the World Trade Organization (WTO).

In June 2022, these consultations were upgraded to the EU-Taiwan Trade and Investment Dialogue, co-chaired by the director-general of DG TRADE and Taiwan’s minister of economic affairs. The second such Trade and Investment Dialogue was held in April 2023. Discussions focused on priority sectors including offshore wind and agri-food, digital trade facilitation measures, and security-related aspects of trade and investment.Taiwan, under the designation of the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei), joined the WTO in January 2002. In December 2008, Taiwan fulfilled an important WTO accession commitment by joining the WTO's Government Procurement Agreement. This marked a significant milestone in Taiwan’s participation in the global trading system, including in the setting up of open, transparent, and non-discriminatory rules in the public procurement markets. Taiwan is also an active participant in plurilateral initiatives in the framework of the WTO, where it has a number of shared interests with the EU. Trade pictureTaiwan was the EU’s 13th biggest trading partner in 2023. Its total goods trade with the EU 27 reached €77.7 billion. EU exports to Taiwan and EU imports from Taiwan amounted to €30.5 billion and €47.8 billion respectively. The EU currently runs a €17.3 billion trade deficit with Taiwan.The EU is Taiwan's 4th largest trading partner after China, the USA and Japan. The EU’s largest export categories to Taiwan are semiconductor machinery (21% of total goods exports in 2023), passenger cars (12%), integrated circuits (10%), and pharmaceuticals (6%). EU imports from Taiwan are dominated by information and communication technology products. The largest categories are integrated circuits (microchips, etc.), which accounted for 23% of EU goods imports from Taiwan in 2023, computers and their parts (accounting for 21%), and phones (7%). There are few trade and investment barriers, and Taiwan is an open economy. However, there are some sectors in which EU companies face market access difficulties, notably in relation to offshore wind power, where EU companies are required to implement stringent local content requirements. In the agriculture sector, EU exports are affected by cumbersome rules and regulations, including slow market access approvals, preventing bilateral trade from realising its full potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and TaiwanWhile the EU pursues its 'One China' policy and recognises the government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, the EU and Taiwan have developed solid relations and close cooperation in a wide range of areas.Four technical working groups deal with issues relating to intellectual property rights, investment, technical barriers to trade, and sanitary and phytosanitary rules.The EU in TaiwanThe European Commission established a European Economic and Trade Office in Taipei in 2003.Since 1988, the European Chamber of Commerce Taipei has represented the interests of EU business in Taiwan, with 30 established sector committees to date.Trading with TaiwanImporting into the EU from TaiwanEU trade defence measures on imports from TaiwanExporting from the EU to TaiwanTrade defence measures in force in TaiwanTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with TaiwanTaiwan is a member of the World Trade Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article17 December 2024EU and Taiwan hold third Trade and Investment DialogueThe EU and Taiwan held the third Trade and Investment Dialogue (TID) on 17 December, taking stock of their bilateral trade and investment relationship.1 min readNews article8 November 2024EU and Taiwan reach understanding on WTO dispute over Taiwan’s offshore wind auctionsThe EU and Taiwan have reached an understanding on the WTO dispute over Taiwan’s offshore wind auctions, outlining terms to address the EU's concerns about unfair treatment of imported goods and services.1 min readNews article26 July 2024EU challenges Taiwan’s discriminatory rules on offshore wind projectsThe EU has today requested dispute settlement consultations at the WTO concerning Taiwan’s use of local content criteria for offshore wind energy projects.1 min readAll the latest news on EU trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Accession negotiations started in 2005, but have not advanced recently. Türkiye is a member of the Union for the Mediterranean.Trade pictureThe EU-Türkiye Customs Union has enabled bilateral trade to increase significantly, reaching a record high of almost €206 billion in 2023. Türkiye became the EU’s 5th largest trade partner in 2023, representing 4.1% of the EU’s total trade in goods with the world (compared to 3.3% in 2022). The EU’s exports of goods to Türkiye totalled €111 billion in 2023. The EU’s imports of goods from Türkiye amounted to €95.5 billion. On both sides, exports of motor vehicles, machinery, and electrical equipment lead the way.The EU stands as Türkiye’s largest goods import and export partner by a significant margin. In 2023, 41% of Türkiye’s exported goods were destined for the EU, while 29% of the country’s imported goods originated from the EU.Total trade in services between the EU and Türkiye amounted to €35 billion in 2022, representing a significant increase from €24.2 billion in 2021. This accounted for 1.4% of the EU’s total trade with the world in services. Transport and travel services are the EU’s most imported services from Türkiye, and transport and ICT services are the EU’s most exported services to Türkiye.*Services data is only available with a delay of one year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and TürkiyeIn 1963, the European Economic Community (the EU’s predecessor) and Türkiye signed an Association Agreement (the ‘Ankara Agreement’), in which both parties agreed to progressively establish a Customs Union over a period of several years. An Additional Protocol was signed in November 1970, setting out a timetable for the abolition of tariffs and quotas on industrial goods circulating between the parties. The final phase of the Customs Union was completed on 1 January 1996 with the implementation of the Association Council Decision No 1/95 (the Customs Union Decision), which is currently in force. The Customs Union Decision both confirmed the liberalised trade regime (the removal of tariffs and quantitative restrictions) for all industrial goods between the EU and Turkey, and established a requirement for Turkey's alignment with the EU's customs tariffs and rules, commercial policy, competition policy, intellectual property rights, and technical legislation related to the scope of the Customs Union.In addition, the EU and Türkiye have concluded two further bilateral preferential trade agreements. The first agreement, the agreement between the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and Türkiye on trade in products covered by the Treaty establishing the ECSC, established a Free Trade Agreement for coal, iron and steel products in 1996, along with relevant competition rules. Further to the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, the EU took over this agreement. The second agreement, Association Council Decision No 1/98 (amended by Decision No 2/2006), provides for preferential concessions on trade in certain agricultural and fishery products.In December 2016, the Commission proposed to modernise the Customs Union and to extend bilateral trade relations to areas such as services, public procurement and sustainable development. The Commission proposal was based on comprehensive preparatory work throughout 2016, which included a public consultation with stakeholders and an impact assessment. However, the Council has not yet adopted the negotiating directives.More information on the Customs Union and preferential arrangementsThe inaugural meeting of a new EU-Türkiye High-Level Dialogue on Trade took place on 8 July 2024 in Brussels. It gave political steer to work on addressing remaining bilateral irritants to trade and allowed for a discussion on several areas of cooperation that would strengthen the functioning of the Customs Union, including the prevention of the circumvention of EU sanctions.Joint Statement: EU-Türkiye High-Level Dialogue on TradeThe EU's engagement with Türkiye on trade, including the establishment of the new High-Level Dialogue on Trade, is guided by a joint communication.Türkiye and the Union for the MediterraneanTürkiye is one of 42 current members of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), which was launched in 2008 as a continuation of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership established at the Barcelona Conference in 1995.This inter-governmental partnership promotes cooperation and dialogue in the Euro-Mediterranean region and brings together all 27 EU Member States and 15 countries of the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean (Albania, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Mauritania, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Palestine*, Syria – suspended, Tunisia and Türkiye; Libya is an observer).The UfM’s strategic objectives are regional stability, human development and regional economic integration.

It formally entered into force on 1 September 2017 following ratification by all EU Member States.The DCFTA has provisionally applied since 1 January 2016.The Priority Action Plan (PAP) (see infographic) for enhanced implementation of the EU-Ukraine DCFTA in 2023-2024 lays down a set of concrete actions to accelerate and monitor the full implementation of the DCFTA, providing Ukraine with further access to the EU Single Market.Trade pictureThe EU is Ukraine's largest trading partner, accounting for 56% of its trade in goods in 2023. Ukraine is the EU's 16th biggest trading partner, accounting for 1.2% of the EU's total trade in goods last year. Total trade in goods between the EU and Ukraine reached €61.9 billion in 2023, meaning that trade in goods has more than doubled since the entry into force of the DCFTA in 2016.The EU's imports from Ukraine amounted to €22.8 billion in 2023. Ukraine's main exports to the EU by value are cereals (21.9% of total exports), animal or vegetable fats and oils (9.2%), ores, slag and ash (8.3%), oil seeds (8.2%), and iron and steel (7.9%). In 2023, Ukraine remained the EU's third-biggest source of EU agrifood imports by value.   The EU's exports to Ukraine amounted to €39.1 billion in 2023. The EU's main exports to Ukraine are mineral fuels and mineral oils (16.6% of all exports), motor vehicles (9.9%), machinery (9.1%), electrical machinery (8.9%),  and arms and ammunition (4.3%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and UkraineThe AA/DCFTA aims to boost trade in goods and services between the EU and Ukraine by gradually cutting tariffs and bringing Ukraine's rules in line with those of the EU in certain industrial sectors and agricultural products.To better integrate with the EU market, Ukraine is aligning its legislation to the EU's norms and standards for industrial and agri-food products. Ukraine is also approximating its legislation to the EU's in trade-related areas such as:Competition;Technical barriers to trade (TBT);Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS);Customs and trade facilitation;Protection of intellectual property rights, and;Public procurement.Response to the Russian war of aggression in UkraineIn response to the Russian Federation's illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol in 2014, the decision by the Russian Federation to recognise the non-government-controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts as independent entities in February 2022 (followed later by Kherson and Zaporizhzhia), and the Russian Federation's unprovoked and unjustified full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the EU has introduced a series of trade-related restrictive measures.Since 2014, the EU has banned the import of goods originating in Crimea and Sevastopol, as well as investments and a number of directly related services there. Similar restrictive measures were adopted in 2022 regarding the non government-controlled areas of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts of Ukraine. This sanctions regime consists of Council Decisions (CFSP) 2022/266 and Council Regulation (EU) 2022/263. The measures therein are very similar to those concerning Crimea and Sevastopol.More informationTemporary measures in support of Ukrainian exports to the EUThe EU has granted Ukraine full trade liberalisation, suspending import duties, quotas and trade defence measures for imports from Ukraine on a temporary basis. This is known as the Autonomous Trade Measures (ATM) Regulation. These measures first entered into force on 4 June 2022 and were renewed for subsequent years on 6 June 2023 and 6 June 2024 respectively. The current measures will remain in force until 5 June 2025. Thanks to these measures, the EU is significantly supporting Ukraine's economy by helping alleviate the difficult situation faced by Ukrainian producers and exporters. More information: Monitoring data on imports from Ukraine into the EU subject to trade liberalisation measuresMore information: EU extends trade support to Ukraine for one more year The Autonomous Trade Measures Regulation contains an emergency brake that is activated if imports of eggs, poultry, sugar, oats, maize, groats or honey exceed average imports between 1 July 2021 and 31 December 2024. The emergency brake has been activated for oats, eggs, sugar, groats and honey. An implementing regulation outlines the monitoring of this emergency brake. The development of imports for the products subject to the emergency brake can be followed in the tariff quota consultation database. The regulation is just one of the measures adopted by the EU in solidarity with Ukraine. More information on other measures is available on the dedicated Commission site.Priority Action PlanThe Priority Action Plan for 2021-2022 (now updated for 2023-2024) was put in place to spur the implementation process of the DCFTA. Since the European Council granted Ukraine candidate status on 23 June 2022, the EU and Ukraine have reached a new stage in their relationship. In her State of the Union speech in September 2022, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the European Commission would work together with Ukraine to ensure seamless access to the Single Market.The purpose of the Priority Action Plan for 2023-2024 is to outline a set of concrete actions – such as working to include Ukraine in the EU’s Roam Like at Home Area and the Single European Payments Area, and to start negotiations on an Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance that will allow free circulation for certain industrial goods – to be undertaken by both sides until the end of 2024.Export ban on unprocessed woodThe EU-Ukraine Association Agreement prohibits any form of export restrictions.In 2015, Ukraine introduced a 10-year export ban for all unprocessed wood, amending and supplementing a 2005 ban on ten wood species of low commercial relevance. The EU considered this ban to be in violation of the AA/DCFTA, and has raised the issue of the export ban at all levels and on all occasions since 2015. In 2020, the EU requested the establishment of an arbitration panel (the Panel) to settle this dispute. In December 2020, the Panel concluded that the export bans are incompatible with Article 35 of the AA, which forbids export prohibitions.The EU is engaging with Ukraine within the framework of the Association Committee in Trade Configuration with a view to encourage Ukraine to comply with the panel conclusions.More informationCommittees and DialoguesThe EU and Ukraine meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the Agreement.Technical committee meetings - agendas and reportsTrading with UkraineImporting into the EU from UkraineEU trade defence measures on imports from Ukraine (currently suspended)Exporting from the EU to UkraineTrade defence measures in force in UkraineTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with UkraineUkraine is a member of the World Trade Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article7 March 2025Commission proposes plan for continued facilitation of Ukraine steel importsThe European Commission has proposed a plan to support Ukraine’s important iron and steel sectors, which would continue to exempt their imports into the EU from trade defence measures.1 min readPress release13 May 2024EU extends trade support to Ukraine for one more year The suspension of import duties and quotas on Ukrainian exports to the European Union will be extended for another year, following today's adoption by the Council and April 23 vote in the European Parliament.1 min readNews article25 February 2024Solidarity with Ukraine: Trade ministers express support for Ukraine ahead of WTO Ministerial - Joint statementJoint Statement of trade ministers in solidarity with Ukraine3 min readAll the latest news on EU trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoland - Polish outdoor equipment company climbs in popularityFjord Nansen is a Polish company specialised in outdoor equipment.

Switzerland is the fourth biggest.The EU's surplus trade in goods with the UK amounted to €113 billion.The EU's main exports of goods to the UK include: Machinery and transport equipment (36%), chemical products (16.8%), foodstuffs, beverages, and tobacco (8%), and base metals (5.8%).The UK's main exports of goods to the EU include: Mineral products (27.6%), machinery and transport equipment (23.4%), and chemical products (15.9%).2021 data for trade in services reveal a balance in favour of the EU: €204.5 billion in EU exports compared to €175 billion in imports from the UK.Other business services, travel, telecommunications, financial services and transport are the most important flows in both directions.Investment flows from the UK to the EU have been stable in recent years, while EU flows to the UK have declined. The stock of mutual investments remains among the highest in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and the United KingdomThe EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement concluded between the EU and the UK sets out preferential arrangements in areas such as:trade in goods;trade in services and investment;digital trade;intellectual property;public procurement;aviation and road transport;energy;fisheries;social security coordination;law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters;thematic cooperation, and;participation in EU programmes.Provisions ensuring a level playing field and respect for fundamental rights underpin it.The Trade and Cooperation Agreement therefore goes beyond traditional free trade agreements and provides a solid basis for preserving the longstanding friendship and cooperation between the EU and the UK.The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement consists of:a Free Trade Agreement, with ambitious cooperation on economic, social, environmental and fisheries issues;a close partnership on citizens’ security, and;an overarching governance framework.Foreign policy, external security and defence cooperation are not covered by the Agreement as the UK did not want to include these. Since 1 January 2021, there has been no framework in place between the UK and the EU to develop and coordinate joint responses to foreign policy challenges, for instance the imposition of sanctions on third-country nationals or economies.The Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not cover any decisions relating to:equivalences for financial services, or;the adequacy of the UK data protection regimeThese are unilateral decisions of the EU and are not subject to negotiation.The EU-UK Free Trade Agreement in detailThe Trade and Cooperation Agreement covers not just trade in goods, services, investment, public procurement and IPR, but also a broad range of other key areas in the EU's interest, such as competition, state aid, tax transparency, air and road transport, energy and sustainability, fisheries, and social security coordination.It provides for zero tariffs and zero quotas on all goods that comply with the appropriate rules of origin.It allows EU investors to establish their companies in the territory of the UK and operate them freely in most sectors.It provides market access beyond that agreed with Japan, for example, and includes regulatory provisions for many key service sectors.It ensures that EU companies already established in the UK will not be discriminated against in public procurement procedures.It secures resale rights for EU artists, which is not covered by international IPR conventions.It ensures undistorted trade and competition for EU companies in the energy and raw materials sectors and for industry in general.It contains a chapter on SMEs designed to promote the participation of SMEs in the agreement.Both parties have committed themselves to ensuring a robust level playing field by maintaining high levels of protection in areas such as:environmental protection;the fight against climate change and carbon pricing;social and labour rights;tax transparency and state aid: with effective domestic enforcement, a binding dispute settlement mechanism, and the possibility for both parties to take remedial measures.The EU and the UK agreed on a new framework for the joint management of fish stocks in EU and UK waters. The UK will be able to develop British fishing activities, while the activities and livelihoods of European fishing communities will be safeguarded, and natural resources preserved.On transport, the agreement provides for continued and sustainable air, road, rail and maritime connectivity. It includes provisions to ensure that competition between EU and UK firms takes place on a level playing field, so that passenger rights, workers' rights and transport safety are not undermined.On energy, the agreement provides a new model for trading and interconnectivity, with guarantees for open and fair competition, including on safety standards for offshore, and production of renewable energy.On social security coordination, the agreement aims at ensuring a number of rights of EU citizens and UK nationals. This concerns EU citizens working in, travelling or moving to the UK and to UK nationals working in, travelling or moving to the EU after 1 January 2021.The agreement enables the UK's continued participation in a number of flagship EU programmes for the period 2021-2027 (subject to a financial contribution by the UK to the EU budget), such as Horizon Europe.More details on the trade part of the agreement.Committees and DialoguesThe EU and the United Kingdom meet regularly to discuss issues and best practices and oversee the proper functioning of the Agreement.Technical committee meetings - agendas and reportsTrading with United KingdomImporting into the EU from the United KingdomEU trade defence measures on imports from the United KingdomExporting from the EU to the United KingdomTrade defence measures in force in the United KingdomTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with the United KingdomThe United Kingdom is a member of the World Trade Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article1 July 2022EU and UK agree on way forward in WTO dispute concerning UK’s green energy subsidy schemeThe EU and the UK have agreed on a way forward to address the EU’s concerns about discrimination in the UK’s Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme, which is the UK’s main mechanism for supporting low-carbon electricity generation.2 min readNews article28 March 2022EU challenges discriminatory practices of UK’s green energy subsidy scheme at WTOToday the EU is requesting consultations with the United Kingdom (UK) at the World Trade Organization (WTO) on the UK’s discriminatory practices when granting support for green energy projects.2 min readAll the latest news on EU trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Taking goods, services and investment into account, the EU and the US are each other’s largest trading partners by far.  Millions of jobs in the United States are related to EU-US trade and investment. The European Union is a reliable source of critical supplies to the United States, including medicinal ingredients and pharmaceutical products, advanced machinery and equipment, and aerospace parts and components. At the same time, the European Union is the largest buyer of the United States’ natural gas and oil, which is an important element for ensuring transatlantic energy security and to allow a shared strong response to Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine. Trade pictureThe transatlantic trade relationship is the most important commercial relationship in the world. EU-US trade in goods and services reached an impressive €1.6 trillion in 2023. This means that every day, €4.4 billion worth of goods and services cross the Atlantic between the EU and the US. EU-US goods and services trade is balanced: the difference between EU exports to the US and US exports to the EU stood at €48 billion in 2023; the equivalent of just 3% of the total trade between the EU and the US.  The total bilateral trade in goods reached €851 billion in 2023. The EU exported €503 billion of goods to the US market, while importing €347 billion; this resulted in a goods trade surplus of €157 billion for the EU.Total bilateral trade in services between the EU and the US was worth €746 billion in 2023. The EU exported €319 billion of services to the US, while importing €427 billion from the US; this resulted in a services trade deficit of €109 billion for the EU. The EU and the US are also major investment partners. EU and US firms have €5.3 trillion worth of investment in each other’s markets (2022 data).  US exports of goods and services to the EU support 2.3 million jobs in the US, and EU firms’ investments in the US employ 3.4 million people.

This Commission met in March 2017. The following Joint Commission should meet again in 2021.\nAs a member of Mercosur, Uruguay is also a Party to the EU-Mercosur Framework Co-operation Agreement signed in 1995, which includes provisions on trade cooperation. Uruguay participated fully in the negotiations of an EU-Mercosur Association Agreement.\nTrade picture\n\nThe EU is currently Uruguay's third trading partner after China and Brazil, capturing 11% of its total trade. EU-Uruguay total bilateral trade amounted to €2.3 billion in 2020.\nEU exports to Uruguay are dominated by manufactured products such as chemicals (32%), machineries (21%) transport equipment (9%) and plastics (4%). This four categories account for two thirds of the EU exports to Uruguay. (2020 data).\nAlmost half of the EU imports from Uruguay are pulp of wood, paper and paperboard (49%) while others were animal products (24%), vegetable products (8%) and wood (4%). (2020 data).\nThe EU is the most important investor in Uruguay with 35% of the FDI in the country and investment stock of approximately €21 billion (2019). In recent years some important EU investments in the country's forestry and paper production sector have had a major impact on overall Foreign Direct Investment levels in Uruguay.\nEU exports of services to Uruguay accounted for €860 million in 2019 and EU imports for €487 million, with a positive balance for the EU (€363 million).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU and Uruguay\nUruguay in Mercosur\nA future EU-Mercosur Association Agreement will provide a boost to regional trade integration among the countries of Mercosur and stimulate new opportunities for trade with the EU by removing tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade.\nThe Mercosur-EU Association Agreement covers, among other issues, trade in goods and services, investment, intellectual property rights (IPR) aspects including protection of geographical indications, government procurement, technical barriers to trade and sanitary and phytosanitary issues, trade and sustainable development.\nMore information on Mercosur\nUruguay and foreign investment\n\nThe possibility of access to other Mercosur markets plays an important role in the attractiveness of Uruguay as a destination of Foreign Direct Investment; a fact that is reinforced by major investments in the Uruguayan forestry and paper production sector.\n\nTrading with Uruguay\n\nImporting into the EU from Uruguay\n\n\t\nEU trade defence measures on imports from Uruguay\n\n\nExporting from the EU to Uruguay\n\t\nTrade defence measures in force in Uruguay\n\n\nTrade relations are part of the EU's overall political and economic relations with Uruguay\nUruguay is a member of the World Trade Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsPress release6 December 2024EU and Mercosur reach political agreement on groundbreaking partnershipToday, the EU and four Mercosur countries finalised negotiations for an EU-Mercosur partnership agreement.1 min readStatement7 December 2023EU-Mercosur Joint Press StatementThe EU and Mercosur are engaged in constructive discussions with a view to finalising the pending issues within the Association Agreement.1 min readNews article8 March 2023Meeting of the European Union-Mercosur chief negotiatorsJoint communiqué of the European Union and Mercosur.1 min readAll the latest news on EU trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinland - Giving Argentinians a taste of traditional Finnish brewingThe company sees growing demand for its types of beer in South America, and especially in Argentina, and would like to launch exports there.

The talks aimed at further liberalising trade, whilst making it easier for developing countries, particularly Least Developed Countries (LDCs), to integrate into the WTO multilateral system.\nThe main issues at stake are:\n\nReforming agricultural subsidies;\nEnsuring that new liberalisation in the global economy respects the need for sustainable economic growth in developing countries, and;\nImproving developing countries' access to global markets for their exports.\n\nDespite the EU's efforts, negotiations have stalled largely due to the lack of readiness from certain WTO Members to reform their agricultural policies.\nResults of the 10th WTO Ministerial Conference\nThe 10th WTO Ministerial Conference took place in December 2015 in Nairobi, Kenya. It was the first WTO Ministerial Conference ever held in Africa.\nThe EU, together with several other countries, put forward a joint compromise proposal to address the question of export competition in agriculture. The proposal constituted an important basis for the final deal, which includes the elimination of export subsidies, and the introduction of new rules for similar measures that also significantly distort international trade and disrupt local markets.\nIn Nairobi, WTO members also agreed on a set of important decisions addressing some demands of the least-developed countries, including:\n\nseeking to simplify the conditions that exporters from the poorest countries have to meet, so that their products benefit from trade agreements (so-called rules of origin);\ngiving more opportunities for businesses from the poorest countries to provide services in the WTO's 164 member countries, and;\nfacilitating the integration of least-developed countries' cotton producers in global trade.\n\nWTO members also agreed to continue negotiations on a longstanding proposal to shield trade-distorting public stockholding programmes for food security in developing countries from legal challenge. They also agreed on a proposal to allow developing countries to temporarily raise their tariffs to deal with import surges or price falls (the so-called 'special safeguard mechanism').\nFinally, ministers signed an important declaration. The Doha Development Agenda was not reconfirmed as such due to differences among WTO members regarding the value of the previously made attempts to reach consensus. While WTO members expressed their strong interest to advance negotiations on remaining Doha issues, some of them also supported the adoption of new approaches to advance on these issues. The declaration also recognises that some members wish to open negotiations on new issues in the WTO.\nResults of the 9th WTO Ministerial Conference\nThe main outcome of the 9th WTO Ministerial Conference was the Trade Facilitation Agreement.  The agreement aims to make it easier and cheaper to import and export by improving customs procedures and making rules more transparent.  Reducing global trade costs by 1% would increase worldwide income by more than USD 40 billion, 65% of which would go to developing countries. The gains from the Trade Facilitation Agreement are expected to be distributed among all countries and regions, with developing landlocked countries benefitting the most.\nThe Trade Facilitation Agreement will enter into force upon its ratification by 2/3 of WTO Members. The EU ratified the agreement in October 2015. \nIn Bali, WTO members also agreed on a series of Doha agriculture and development issues.\nMore on the Doha Development Agenda\n\nWTO website\nFactsheet: How the EU works with the WTO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTune in to trade policy insights19 December 2024Episode 10Tom Moylan meets the new Trade and Economic Security Commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, to discuss Mercosur, tariffs, and trust.19/12/2024 | Episode 10 | 29 minutes14 November 2024Episode 9Do you care about where our goods come from?

The EU Trade Commissioner represents the EU in this forum.The European Commission also represents the EU inthe General Council of the WTO, which acts on behalf of the Ministerial Conference and meets regularlysubsidiary WTO bodies, which set up rules for specific areas of world trade, e.g. respecting the environment and monitor how they’re appliedPermission and responsibilityThe Commission gets permission from the Council of the EU to negotiate on behalf of the European Union.The Commission coordinates the EU negotiating position with the EU Member States by consulting with the Council's trade policy committee.The Commission regularly informs the European Parliament's International Trade Committee (INTA) of WTO issues.When an agreement is negotiated at the WTO, the Commission needs the formal authorisation of the Council and European Parliament to then sign the agreement on behalf of the EU.The Commission initiates and handles WTO complaints with the Council support and may propose retaliatory measures to the Council.The Commission also regularly talks with other interested groups (civil society) on developments related to its WTO policy.More on the EU and the WTO Getting Covid-19 vaccines to everyone in need - WTO global pandemic response Putting an end to unsustainable fishing - WTO agreement on fisheries subsidies \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTune in to trade policy insights19 December 2024Episode 10Tom Moylan meets the new Trade and Economic Security Commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, to discuss Mercosur, tariffs, and trust.19/12/2024 | Episode 10 | 29 minutes14 November 2024Episode 9Do you care about where our goods come from?

The openness of our trade regime has meant that the EU is the biggest player on the global trading scene and remains a good region to do business with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade topicsEU companies accessing world marketsImporting into the EUTrade policy\n\n\n\nThe EU has achieved a strong position by acting together with one voice on the global stage, rather than with separate trade strategies.\n\n\nEurope has become deeply integrated into global markets. Thanks to the ease of modern transport and communications, it is now easier to produce, buy and sell goods around the world, which gives European companies of every size the potential to trade outside Europe.\nWorkers often deliver their services across different countries within a multinational or by specific service contracts.\nAs investors thrive in a stable, sound and predictable environment, they are looking for investment barriers to be dismantled and investments to be protected.\n\nEvery day, Europe exports hundreds of millions of euros worth of goods, and imports hundreds of millions more.\nEurope is the world's largest exporter of manufactured goods and services, and is itself the biggest export market for around 80 countries.\nTogether, the European Union's members account for 16% of world imports and exports (2022 data).\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThe development of trade – if properly managed – is an opportunity for economic growth. So EU trade policy seeks to create growth and jobs by increasing the opportunities for trade and investment with the rest of the world.\nBy working together, Europe has the weight to shape an open global trading system based on fair rules – and to ensure that those rules are respected.\nThe EU’s success is inextricably bound up with the success of our trading partners, both in the developed and developing world. For this reason, sustainable development is central to trade policy.\n\nThe EU is an attractive market to do business with\n\nWe have 440 million consumers looking for quality goods.\nWe are the world's largest single market, with transparent rules and regulations.\nWe have a secure legal investment framework that is among the most open in the world.\nWe are the most open market to developing countries in the world.\n\nFacts and figures on the EU’s position in global markets\n\nThe EU is the largest economy in the world. Although growth is projected to be slow, the EU remains the largest economy in the world with a GDP per head of €25,000 for its 440 million consumers.\nThe EU is the world's largest trading bloc. The EU is the world’s largest trader of manufactured goods and services.\nThe EU ranks first in both inbound and outbound international investments.\nThe EU is the top trading partner for 80 countries. By comparison, the US is the top trading partner for a little over 20 countries.\nThe EU is the most open to developing countries. Fuels excluded, the EU imports more from developing countries than the USA, Canada, Japan and China put together.\n\nThe EU benefits from being one of the most open economies in the world and remains committed to free trade.\n\nThe average applied tariff for goods imported into the EU is very low. More than 70% of imports enter the EU at zero or reduced tariffs.\nThe EU’s services markets are highly open and we have arguably the most open investment regime in the world.\nThe EU has not reacted to the crisis by closing markets. However, some of the EU’s trading partners have not been so restrained, as the EU has highlighted in the Trade and Investment Barriers Report.\nIn fact the EU has retained its capacity to conclude and implement trade agreements. Free trade agreements with South Korea and with Singapore are examples of this and the EU has an ambitious agenda of trade agreements in the pipeline.\n\nMore on EU position in world trade\n\nEU trade agreements deliver on growth and jobs, support sustainable development.\nEurope 2020 – Europe's growth strategy\nWho does trade benefit and how? 10 benefits for trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTune in to trade policy insights19 December 2024Episode 10Tom Moylan meets the new Trade and Economic Security Commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, to discuss Mercosur, tariffs, and trust.19/12/2024 | Episode 10 | 29 minutes14 November 2024Episode 9Do you care about where our goods come from?

This means the EU institutions make laws on trade matters, and negotiate and conclude international trade agreements.The EU's responsibilities cover:trade in goods and services;the commercial aspects of intellectual property, such as patents;public procurement, and;foreign direct investment.Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union sets out the rules on EU trade policy.An open, sustainable and assertive EU trade strategyOn 18 February 2021, the European Commission set out its new trade strategy for the coming years.Reflecting the concept of ‘Open Strategic Autonomy’, it builds on the EU’s openness to contribute to the economic recovery by supporting the green and digital transformations.The strategy includes a renewed focus on strengthening multilateralism and reforming global trade rules to ensure that they are fair and sustainable.Where necessary, the EU will take a more assertive stance in defending its interests and values, including through new tools.Why the EU negotiates trade dealsBy acting together as one, EU countries benefit from increased negotiating power when making trade deals with other countries.The EU negotiates trade agreements to strengthen our economy and create jobs.EU trade agreements help to do that in two ways. Trade agreements let European businesses:access more easily and at lower prices the raw materials and other inputs they need, helping them to stay competitive, and;compete more effectively abroad and export more to countries and regions outside the EU.This increase in trade leads to growth in the economy and helps create jobs. It also gives consumers a wider choice of products at lower prices.In addition, projecting EU rules and values in trade agreements helps the EU shape globalisation, especially on issues like human rights, working conditions and environmental protection.How the EU negotiates trade dealsFirst, the European Commission requests authorisation from the Council of the EU ('the Council') to negotiate a trade agreement with a trade partner. The Council's authorisation can include 'directives'. These are often referred to as the 'mandate' and set out what the Commission should achieve in the agreement.Then the Commission negotiates with the trading partner on behalf of the EU. During the negotiations, the Commission:  works closely with the Council's trade policy committee;keeps the European Parliament fully informed;holds meetings with representatives of civil society, and;publishes:EU position papers;proposed texts for the agreement;reports of negotiations;impact assessments;background papers, and;factsheets.Negotiations might include:removing or cutting customs duties (taxes) on goods that European companies export;scrapping any limits (quotas) on the amounts the partner country allows EU firms to export to it;allowing EU businesses to provide services and bid for public contracts in the partner country, and;cutting bureaucracy to make it easier for EU firms to export, but maintaining things like health and safety standards or environmental protection.Once the Commission completes the negotiations, it publishes the agreement and presents the deal to the Council and the European Parliament.The Council and the European Parliament examine the final deal and decide whether or not to approve it.If they both approve it, the EU can conclude the agreement. If the trade agreement covers areas where EU countries have responsibility, it can only be fully concluded after EU countries also ratify and sign the agreement.Putting EU trade policy into effectThe European Commission helps put EU trade policy into effect. This sometimes involves updating the EU's existing trade laws.Two of the ways it does so are delegated acts and implementing acts.Between signing and ratifying the deal, parts of the agreement can be 'provisionally applied' – put into effect before ratification – if the Council decides to do so.Provisional application usually only takes effect once the European Parliament has given its consent.More information on bilateral dealsDocumentsTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)Common commercial policyHow agreements are negotiatedThe legal acts of the Union: Delegated actsThe legal acts of the Union: Implementing actsProcedures for the adoption of acts and other provisionsWhat did the Lisbon Treaty change?Transparency in EU trade negotiationsAnnual activity reportAnnual activity report 2023: TradeFinancing DecisionsDG Trade Financing Decision 2025 and AnnexDG Trade Financing Decision 2024 and AnnexDG Trade Financing Decision 2023 and AnnexDG Trade Financing Decision 2022 and AnnexDG Trade Financing Decision 2021 and AnnexDG Trade Financing Decision 2020 and Annex\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEU trade meetings with Civil SocietyContribute to a transparent and accountable EU trade policy by joining consultations with European civil society.View all EU trade meetings with civil society\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTune in to trade policy insights19 December 2024Episode 10Tom Moylan meets the new Trade and Economic Security Commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, to discuss Mercosur, tariffs, and trust.19/12/2024 | Episode 10 | 29 minutes14 November 2024Episode 9Do you care about where our goods come from?

To become a member of an EU DAG, an EU organisation must:Be an independent and not-for-profit civil society organisation;Represent or promote EU interests;Have specific expertise or competence on areas covered by the mandate of the DAG, and;Be registered in both the Transparency Register of the European Commission/European Parliament/Council of the EU and in the Civil Society Dialogue database of DG Trade.Some members are designated by the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC).Civil society meetings and involvement in trade agreementsDAG members meet several times a year to discuss issues under their mandate in the framework of a trade agreement. They advise the EU and its trade partners, who discuss the issues raised at their annual meeting. Once per year, a joint civil society meeting is organised under each trade agreement. This meeting is generally open to all civil society organisations beyond DAG members. The DAGs from the EU and from the partner country or countries also meet in a back-to-back session alongside the joint meeting.Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) ReviewIn DG Trade’s TSD Review of June 2022, the Commission outlined several measures to ensure more participation and support for civil society:Make it easier for civil society and DAGs to lodge complaints on violations of sustainability commitments in trade agreementsIntroduce timelines for the Commission to follow as a general rule when dealing with TSD complaints, by updating the Operating Guidelines for the Single Entry Point on trade agreements;Better involve DAGs in technical assistance projects and in meetings with EU Member States;Ensure more transparency regarding the work of the DAGs, including publishing the lists of participating organisations, and promoting interaction between DAGs, and;Further strengthen the role of EU DAGs by providing resources for their functioning.Further information on involving civil society organisationsAny EU civil society organisation can file a complaint on sustainability issues in EU trade agreements. Consultation with civil society begins long before an agreement enters into force. The EU engages with civil society before negotiations for an agreement have even begun. The Commission keeps receiving input throughout the process via Civil Society Dialogue meetings and regular contact with stakeholders. It also publishes negotiation round reports and other relevant documents.The Commission conducts Sustainability Impact Assessments (SIAs), which are in-depth analyses of the potential economic, social, human rights and environmental impacts of ongoing trade negotiations, as well as ex-post evaluations to assess whether trade agreements are working as expected in achieving their objectives and why. These assessments are an opportunity for stakeholders in both the EU and in the partner countries to share their views with the Commission.Find below the list of EU DAGs information on joint meetings between DAG members from both parties, and on Trade and Sustainable Development Committees between the EU and partner countries.Information about DAGs can be found on the website of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC)CANADAText of the Agreement (Article 24.13)Reports of meetings / work plans / joint statements:Civil Society Forum Trade and Sustainable Development CommitteeMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory GroupCARIFORUMEU Domestic Advisory Group membersText of the Agreement (Article 232)Reports of meetings / work plans / joint statementsMore information on the EU Domestic advisory groupCENTRAL AMERICAText of the Agreement (Article 10)Reports of meetings / work plans / joint statementsMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory GroupCOLOMBIA/ECUADOR/PERU – ANDEAN COMMUNITYText of the Agreement (Article 282)Reports of meetings / work plans / joint statementsMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory GroupGEORGIAText of the Agreement (Articles 240 and 241)Reports of meetings / work plans / joint statementsMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory GroupJAPANText of the Agreement (Article 16.15)Reports of meetings / work plans / joint statements:Civil Dociety Forum Trade and Sustainable Development CommitteeMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory GroupMOLDOVAText of the Agreement (Articles 376 and 377)Reports of meetings / work plans / joint statementsMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory GroupREPUBLIC OF KOREAText of the Agreement (Articles 13.12 and 13.13)Reports of meetings / work plans / joint statements:Civil Society ForumTrade and Sustainable Development CommitteeInformation on the EU-Republic of Korea TSD dispute settlement caseMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory GroupSINGAPOREText of the Agreement (Article 12.15)Reports of meetings / work plans / joint statements:Civil Society Forum Trade and Sustainable Development CommitteeMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory GroupUKRAINEText of the Agreement (Article 299)Rules of Procedure of the Trade and Sustainable Development CommitteeReports of meetings / work plans / joint statements:Civil Society ForumTrade and Sustainable Development CommitteeMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory GroupUNITED KINGDOMText of the Agreement (Articles 12, 13 and 14)Reports of meetings / work plans / joint statements:Civil Society Forum Committee on Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition and Sustainable DevelopmentMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory GroupVIETNAMText of the Agreement (Article 13.14)Reports of meetings / work plans / joint statements:Civil Society Forum Trade and Sustainable Development CommitteeMore information on the EU Domestic Advisory GroupMore information2023 call for the renewal of Domestic Advisory Groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTune in to trade policy insights19 December 2024Episode 10Tom Moylan meets the new Trade and Economic Security Commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, to discuss Mercosur, tariffs, and trust.19/12/2024 | Episode 10 | 29 minutes14 November 2024Episode 9Do you care about where our goods come from?

They then sell those minerals to fund their activities, for example to buy weapons. \nThese so-called 'conflict minerals', such as tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, can find their way into our mobile phones, cars and jewellery.\nA new EU law to stem the trade in conflict minerals\nTherefore, the EU passed a new regulation in May 2017 to stop:\n\nconflict minerals and metals from being exported to the EU;\nglobal and EU smelters and refiners from using conflict minerals, and;\nmine workers from being abused.\n\nThe law also supports the development of local communities.\nIt requires EU companies to ensure they import these minerals and metals from responsible sources only.  \nThe requirements start to apply on 1 January 2021.\nTransparency platform for downstream companies\nThe Commission will soon release an online platform where downstream companies can voluntarily share information on their due diligence for metals and minerals. The platform is in its final preparatory phase. Stakeholders interested in this process can contact TRADE-RESPONSIBLE-SOURCINGec [dot] europa [dot] eu (TRADE-RESPONSIBLE-SOURCING[at]ec[dot]europa[dot]eu) for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about the EU's new conflict minerals law\nThe regulation explainedOn 1 January 2021 a new law came into full force across the EU – the Conflict Minerals Regulation.Help for your businessLearn about the support on offer to help you source responsibly.Legal texts and other documentsSee the text of the regulation, tenders, and EU studies on conflict minerals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews announcement4 January 2024Award Notice: Indicative, Non-exhaustive List of Conflict Affected and High-risk Areas (The CAHRA List) under Regulation (EU) 2017/821 – Responsible Sourcing of MineralsTRADE/2023/NP/0031 Indicative, Non-exhaustive List of Conflict Affected and High-risk Areas (The CAHRA List) under Regulation (EU) 2017/821 – Responsible Sourcing of MineralsNews announcement19 October 2023Award Notice: Framework Contract for the Recognition of Equivalence of Supply Chain Due Diligence Schemes under the Regulation (EU)2017/821 (Conflict Minerals)TRADE/2023/OP/0011 Framework Contract for the Recognition of Equivalence of Supply Chain Due Diligence Schemes under the Regulation (EU)2017/821 (Conflict Minerals)General publications4 May 2023Call for Tender - Framework Contract for the Recognition of Equivalence of Supply Chain Due Diligence Schemes under the Regulation (EU)2017/821 (Conflict Minerals)TRADE/2023/OP/0011 Framework Contract for the Recognition of Equivalence of Supply Chain Due Diligence Schemes under the Regulation (EU)2017/821 (Conflict Minerals)See all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews announcement4 January 2024Award Notice: Indicative, Non-exhaustive List of Conflict Affected and High-risk Areas (The CAHRA List) under Regulation (EU) 2017/821 – Responsible Sourcing of MineralsTRADE/2023/NP/0031 Indicative, Non-exhaustive List of Conflict Affected and High-risk Areas (The CAHRA List) under Regulation (EU) 2017/821 – Responsible Sourcing of MineralsNews announcement19 October 2023Award Notice: Framework Contract for the Recognition of Equivalence of Supply Chain Due Diligence Schemes under the Regulation (EU)2017/821 (Conflict Minerals)TRADE/2023/OP/0011 Framework Contract for the Recognition of Equivalence of Supply Chain Due Diligence Schemes under the Regulation (EU)2017/821 (Conflict Minerals)General publications4 May 2023Call for Tender - Framework Contract for the Recognition of Equivalence of Supply Chain Due Diligence Schemes under the Regulation (EU)2017/821 (Conflict Minerals)TRADE/2023/OP/0011 Framework Contract for the Recognition of Equivalence of Supply Chain Due Diligence Schemes under the Regulation (EU)2017/821 (Conflict Minerals)See all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It was signed in Apia, Samoa on 15 November 2023 and entered into provisional application on 1 January 2024. The modernised partnership provides a new legal framework for the EU’s relations with OACPS members for the next 20 years. The agreement comprises a common foundation and three regional protocols (for Africa, for the Caribbean, and for the Pacific). The Samoa Agreement is the successor of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, concluded in 2000. The Cotonou agreement offered EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries the opportunity to negotiate development-oriented free trade arrangements called Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). EPAs are stand-alone international agreements that remain anchored to the essential and fundamental elements of the Samoa Agreement, as was the case for the Cotonou Partnership Agreement. Economic Partnership Agreements in a nutshellThe EU is the biggest trading partner of the ACP group of countries, with 19% of their total trade flows.Eight Economic Partnership Agreements are in application with 33 out of 79 ACP countries. These include 14 Caribbean countries, 15 African countries and four Pacific countries. Other ACP countries benefit from privileged access to the EU via the EU’s Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP), mostly using the Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme.EPAs are WTO-compatible agreements. They go beyond conventional free-trade agreements to focus on ACP countries’ development, taking account of their socio-economic circumstances. They include co-operation and assistance (for example, in areas such as sanitary norms and standards) to help EPA countries benefit from the agreements.EPAs are tailor-made to suit specific regional circumstances.EPAs open the EU’s markets to EPA countries immediately.EPAs create joint institutions that monitor the implementation of the agreements and address trade issues in a cooperative way.EPAs are drivers of change that contribute to reform and good economic governance. Top 10 benefits of EPAs for partner countriesEPAs: leveraging trade and investment for sustainable developmentThe overall objective of EPAs is to leverage trade and investment for sustainable development, and hence contribute to eradicating poverty.EPAs include the following features that go beyond access to EU markets:EPAs are permanent partnerships that encourage a progressive shift from aid to trade and investment as engines of growth, jobs and poverty reduction. They entail rights and obligations for both EU and ACP countries.EPAs offer zero tariffs and unlimited quantities (duty and quota-free) for all products (except for arms).EPAs also have flexible conditions (rules of origin) under which exporters in EPA countries can more easily source from elsewhere the inputs they need to make their final products without losing their free access to the EU.EPA partners do not pay tariffs or duties on their exports to the EU, while they open their markets only partially to the EU (on average 80%), with long transition periods for doing so. Safeguard measures can be activated if surges in imports of EU products disturb local markets.EPAs support ACP countries' efforts to develop new industries and diversify their economies by shifting their reliance on commodities to higher-value products and services.EPAs contribute to a stable and conducive investment climate by providing certainty on trade rules governing exports and imports from the EU. This helps to attract foreign investors to establish production in a given country.EPAs aim to contribute to regional economic integration by linking smaller markets in larger EPA regions that were established by the ACP countries themselves.EU trade policy and development cooperation mutually reinforce one another. Through its Aid for Trade initiative, the EU supports partner countries in preparing and implementing regional and bilateral trade. Aid for Trade strengthens ACP countries’ trade policy capacity, and enhances private sector development via access to finance, skills, services, infrastructure and other inputs that help SMEs to become competitive in global markets.The focus is currently on implementing the EPAs and extending their scope.Once an EPA has been signed and ratified and applies, the focus of the process moves to implementation. This means putting the partnership into practice, to enable the private sector and consumers alike to reap the benefits of these agreements. EPAs are already delivering business benefits in the countries concerned, ranging from textiles from Madagascar, grapes from Namibia and processed fish from Papua New Guinea to medical instruments from Mauritius.Read more on each EPA’s status of implementation in the EU’s annual FTA Implementation and Enforcement Report. The accompanying Staff Working Document features sections on the EU-Southern African Development Community (SADC) EPA, the EU-Cote d’Ivoire EPA, the EU-Ghana EPA, the EU-Cameroon EPA, the EU-Cariforum EPA, and the EU-Pacific EPA).The scope of EPAs can be extended by:Supporting accession to EPAs by interested parties. For example, Samoa joined the EU-Pacific EPA in 2018; the Solomon Islands joined in 2020; Niue, Tonga and Tuvalu will start applying the agreement after they have notified the EU that they have completed their internal adoption procedures; and accession processes are underway with the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Timor-Leste, and Vanuatu. Comoros joined the EU-Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) EPA in 2019. Angola has requested accession to the EU-SADC EPA.Adding more trade-related topics to EPAs – for example, trade in services, investment, trade and sustainable development – to modernise them, such as during ongoing negotiations to modernise the EPA with five Eastern and Southern African (ESA-5) countries.EPAs in Africa: Towards a continental visionIn Africa, EPAs are key tools of the EU’s Comprehensive Strategy with Africa. The economic pillar of this strategy identifies trade – alongside regional and continental economic integration – as major elements to promote the sustainable development of African countries. The 2021 Trade Policy Review Communication confirmed that Africa is of particular importance to the EU’s trade policy.Factsheet on EU-Africa trade and investment relationsMeetings and documents on the relationship between the EPAs and the ACTFAIn Sub-Saharan Africa, there are currently 15 countries implementing an EPA. Most other countries benefit from preferential unilateral schemes.Infographic on the EU-Africa trade partnershipEPAs with Sub-Saharan African countries and other EU free trade agreements with Northern African countries contribute to the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). EPAs already contain useful trade tools for building the AfCFTA. They also reinforce the trade capacity of EU partners.Factsheet on synergies between the AfCFTA and EU-Africa trade agreementsThe pursuit of sustainable investment agreements with Africa aims to step up engagement with African partners. The core purpose of investment facilitation is to enhance the investment climate and encourage ongoing reforms aimed at attracting and retaining foreign direct investment (FDI). Agreements such as the EU-Angola sustainable investment facilitation agreement, which entered into force in September 2024, are designed to further enhance sustainable trade and investment links between both continents and within Africa itself.  The 79 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries*Angola – Antigua and Barbuda – Belize – Cape Verde – Comoros – Bahamas – Barbados – Benin – Botswana – Burkina Faso – Burundi – Cameroon – Central African Republic – Chad – Congo (Brazzaville) – Congo (Kinshasa) – Cook Islands – Cote d'Ivoire – Cuba – Djibouti – Dominica – Dominican Republic – Eritrea – Eswatini – Ethiopia – Fiji – Gabon – Gambia – Ghana – Grenada – Republic of Guinea – Guinea-Bissau – Equatorial Guinea – Guyana – Haiti – Jamaica – Kenya – Kiribati – Lesotho – Liberia – Madagascar – Malawi – Maldives – Mali – Marshall Islands – Mauritania – Mauritius – Micronesia – Mozambique – Namibia – Nauru – Niger – Nigeria – Niue – Palau – Papua New Guinea – Rwanda – St. Kitts and Nevis – St. Lucia – St. Vincent and the Grenadines – Solomon Islands – Samoa – Sao Tome and Principe – Senegal – Seychelles – Sierra Leone – Somalia – Sudan – Suriname – Tanzania – Timor-Leste – Togo – Tonga – Trinidad and Tobago – Tuvalu – Uganda – Vanuatu – Zambia – Zimbabwe*South Africa withdrew from OACPS in September 2022 but remains a partner of the EU-SADC EPA.ACP-EU trade in figuresTotal trade between the EU and ACP countries was worth €114 billion in 2023, with a surplus in ACP countries' favour of €13 billion.Total trade has increased by 66% since 2010.   The EU is ACP countries' biggest trade partner, with 19% of their total trade flows.EU share of ACP exports: 23%EU share of ACP imports: 16%Committees and DialoguesEPA partners meet regularly to discuss the implementation of the agreements.Meetings and documents on implementation:EU-CARIFORUM EPA: Meetings and documentsEU-Cameroon EPA: Meetings and documentsEU-Cote d'Ivoire EPA: Meetings and documentsEU-ESA (Eastern and Southern Africa) EPA: Meetings and documentsEU-Ghana interim EPA: Meetings and documentsEU-Pacific (Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands) EPA: Meetings and documentsEU-SADC (Southern African Development Community) EPA: Meetings and documentsImplementation overview:Overview of EPAs - state of playRegional EPA pagesCentral AfricaEastern and Southern AfricaEast African CommunitySouthern African Development CommunityWest AfricaCaribbeanPacific\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews announcement13 January 2025Award Notice: Study in support of an ex-post evaluation of the agreement between the EU and Japan for an Economic PartnershipEC-TRADE/2024/OP/0003: Study in support of an ex-post evaluation of the Agreement between the European Union and Japan for an Economic PartnershipNews article18 October 2024Commission continues work to deepen trade and investment relations with Eastern and Southern African countriesA European Commission report published today highlights the good progress made in recent negotiations to deepen trade and investment relations with five Eastern and Southern African partners.1 min readStatement6 September 2024Joint Statement between the EU and Kenya on the implementation of the EPAA joint statement published by the European Union and Kenya on the implementation of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA).1 min readSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest eventsPartner meetingsCSD on EU trade and investment relations with Sub-Saharan AfricaWednesday 20 November 2024, 09:30 - 11:30 (CET)Online onlyPartner meetingsCSD meeting on the evaluation of the EU-SADC Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA): Draft final reportThursday 11 July 2024, 10:00 - 12:00 (CEST)Live streaming availablePartner meetings6th EU-GCC Business ForumThursday 24 November 2022, 09:00 - 18:00 (CET)See all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) was born. Today, about a dozen countries have GSP mechanisms in place.Generalised Scheme of Preferences in a nutshellThe European Union’s GSP is widely recognised as the most progressive in terms of coverage and benefits.The EU's GSP comprises three arrangements:Standard GSP for low and lower-middle income countries. This means a partial or full removal of customs duties on two-thirds of tariff lines.GSP+: a special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance. GSP+ slashes these same tariffs to 0% for vulnerable low- and lower-middle income countries that implement 27 international conventions related to labour and human rights, environmental and climate protection, and good governance.EBA (Everything But Arms): the special arrangement for least developed countries (LDCs), providing them with duty-free, quota-free access to the EU market for all products except arms and ammunition.Find the arrangement that benefits your countryList of GSP beneficiary countriesGSP statistics: details regarding benefits per regime, country and productVisit the Access to Markets portal to find the scheme that benefits your country.ConditionsDeveloping countries are automatically granted GSP if they:Are classified as having an income level below 'upper middle income' by the World Bank.Do not benefit from another arrangement (like a Free Trade Agreement) granting them preferential access to the EU market.  Are on the list of eligible countries.In addition, if a country applies for GSP+ status, the beneficiary country is required to ratify 27 international conventions, and to cooperate with the European Commission to monitor the implementation of these conventions related to environmental and climate protection, and good governance listed in the GSP Regulation.LDCs are automatically granted the benefits of the ‘Everything But Arms’ arrangement, even if they have another arrangement in place.All GSP beneficiary countries have to respect the principles of fifteen core conventions on human rights and labour rights listed in the GSP Regulation.MonitoringThe EU continuously monitors GSP+ beneficiary countries’ effective implementation of the 27 international conventions on human rights, labour rights, environmental and climate protection, and good governance. This monitoring includes exchanges of information, dialogue and visits, and it involves various stakeholders, including civil society.The Commission publishes a report on the implementation of GSP every two years, providing information on the progress made by the GSP+ beneficiary countries in implementing the 27 international conventions.Report for 2020-2022 and its country annexes:ArmeniaBangladesh, Cambodia and MyanmarBoliviaCabo VerdeKyrgyz RepublicPakistanMongoliaPhilippinesSri LankaUzbekistanKey facts on the reportEnhanced engagement with other GSP beneficiariesAs announced in Trade for All, the EU has stepped up its engagement with three GSP beneficiary countries: Bangladesh, Cambodia and Myanmar.The EU is engaging with these countries due to the gravity of alleged shortcomings in respecting core human rights and labour rights standards, as testified by reports from the United Nations, the International Labour Organization, and civil society.GSP preferences can be removed if beneficiary countries fail to respect core human rights and labour rights. On 12 February 2020, the Commission decided to withdraw part of the tariff preferences granted to Cambodia under the European Union’s Everything But Arms (EBA) trade arrangement due to serious and systematic violations of the human rights principles enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. See Legal Act and Memo.As part of the biennial report, a specific report was published on the Enhanced Engagement, which provides details on issues discussed and priorities for further monitoring with the countries concerned.Impact of GSPA 2018 GSP mid-term evaluation shows that the EU’s GSP is delivering on its main objectives of contributing to poverty eradication and sustainable development in GSP beneficiary countries.The evaluation indicates that countries increasingly use the available trade preferences and diversify their exports. Moreover, GSP+ beneficiaries saw an economic incentive for making progress in ratifying and implementing the 27 international conventions required under GSP+.Between 2014 and 2019, the 27 EU Member States' imports from current GSP beneficiaries utilising any of the existing arrangements increased by 25%, whereas overall imports from third countries increased by 16% over the same period. Imports under EBA even outperformed this, increasing by 47% (from 17.1 billion EUR in 2014 to 25.2 billion EUR in 2019). Imports from LDCs accounted for 2% of the EU’s total imports in 2019; 67% of these imports from LDCs benefitted from EBA preferences.GSP ReviewOn 22 September 2021, the Commission adopted a legislative proposal for the EU’s Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) for the period 2024-2034.The current GSP Regulation is set to expire by the end of 2023. The Commission is proposing to continue the scheme while improving some of its key features. The aim is to respond to the evolving needs and challenges of GSP countries, and to strengthen the scheme’s social, environmental and climate aspects. The review is based on the 2018 Mid-Term Evaluation (MTE) of GSP, the External Study supporting the Impact Assessment, a Commission Impact Assessment, and the 2020 Open Public Consultation that confirmed the achievements of the EU GSP.Extension of the current GSP RegulationIn November 2023, the Council of EU Member States and the European Parliament signed an amendment to the existing Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) Regulation, in order to extend the GSP scheme  for the period 2024-2027.As the current scheme is set to expire at the end of 2023, this extension will provide legal certainty to beneficiary countries, and to businesses and operators present in these countries and in the EU. The extension of the current scheme will shortly be published in the EU’s Official Journal, and will take effect the day after its publication.This will allow GSP beneficiaries to continue enjoying tariff preferences, as the Council and the Parliament have not yet reached an agreement on the Commission's proposal of September 2021 to update the GSP rules. The proposal to extend the current GSP scheme was put forward by the Commission in July 2023.Involving stakeholdersEuropean Parliament and Council of the European UnionThe Commission regularly reports to the European Parliament, and to the Council of the European Union, on GSP matters. The Commission also regularly answers questions from Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). These questions (and responses) and related issues can be found on the European Parliament's website.The Council is overseeing the GSP through the Working Party on the Generalised System of Preferences.In addition, the Commission chairs the Expert Group on the Generalised Scheme of Preferences and the Generalised Preferences Committee, which gathers expert representatives from each Member State to oversee and vote on issues related to the GSP.IndustryThe GSP Regulation has several ways to ensure that the interests of European industries are safeguarded:GSP beneficiaries that become 'upper middle-income' countries are removed from the GSP.GSP beneficiaries can lose preferences for specific product categories that are deemed to have become sufficiently competitive: suspended tariff preferences for 2020-2022.Safeguard measures can be requested by EU industry based on evidence that imports from a GSP beneficiary have caused serious economic difficulties for that industry: safeguard measures on rice from Cambodia and Myanmar.ContactFor any further questions regarding the GSP, please contact TRADE-GSPec [dot] europa [dot] eu (TRADE-GSP[at]ec[dot]europa[dot]eu)More on the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP)EU GSP Regulation (2012)All implementing acts of the GSP RegulationAll delegated acts of the GSP RegulationCommission proposal for a GSP Regulation post-2023Mid-term Evaluation (October 2018)Legislative Train Schedule for the review of the GSP RegulationPublic Consultation on the GSP (now closed)Study in support of an impact assessment of the post-2023 EU GSP RegulationCommission impact assessment on the proposal for a GSP Regulation post-2023GSP HubGSP+ factsheet, May 2019GSP Handbook/Insights, September 2021Personal data protection: the EU institutions and bodies process personal data in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.

The Compact aims to create a legal framework for labour rights, health and safety standards in clothing factories in Bangladesh and to ensure they are applied. It was a response to the 2013 Rana Plaza tragedy, in which over 1,100 people died when a garment factory collapsed.\nSince the compact took effect:\n\n235 new inspectors have been recruited to ensure safety conditions in industrial buildings, and;\nNearly 350 trade unions have been created and 220 Workers' Welfare Associations registered with the right to collective bargaining.\n\nAnother example is the Initiative to Promote Fundamental Labour Rights and Practices in Myanmar of 2015. The initiative also includes the government of Myanmar, the US, Denmark, Japan and the International Labour Organization. It aims to:\n\nhelp promote fundamental rights for workers in Myanmar;\ncreate opportunities for businesses in Myanmar, and;\nhelp transform Myanmar into an attractive trading and investment partner.\n\nMore information:\n\nEuropean Commission working document on trade and child labour (2013)\nBangladesh Sustainability Compact - Technical Status Report (July 2016)\nJoint statement by the second stakeholders forum on labour law reform and institutional capacity building, Yangon, 30 September 2016\nLetter from the European Commission on labour reforms included in the EU-Korea trade agreement (March 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsGeneral publications18 February 2025Prior information notice: Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment in support of Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations between the EU and ThailandEC-TRADE/2025/OP/0002: Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment in support of Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations between the EU and ThailandGeneral publications3 February 2025Call for tender: Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) and Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) Compliance Support FacilityEC-TRADE/2024/OP/0024: Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) and Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) Compliance Support Facility1 min readNews article12 December 2024EU and US host Minerals Security Partnership Forum workshop on critical minerals supply chainsToday, the EU, the United States and other stakeholders in the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) participated in a workshop on public-private Investment in critical minerals.2 min readSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest eventsPartner meetingsCSD on the impact of EU FTAs on key environmental aspects, including climateTuesday 25 February 2025, 09:00 - 11:00 (CET)Brussels, BelgiumLive streaming availablePartner meetings11th meeting of the EU-Andean Civil Society ForumThursday 28 November 2024, 14:00 - 17:30 (CET)Partner meetingsFourth meeting of the EU-Vietnam Joint Forum on TSD under the EVFTAThursday 21 November 2024, 09:00 - 11:00 (CET)Live streaming availableSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

To achieve sustainable development, policies in these three areas have to work together and support each other.\nIn 2015, world leaders agreed on Agenda 2030, a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets proposed by the United Nations.\nThe EU was instrumental in shaping Agenda 2030. The EU and its member countries are fully committed to implementing Agenda 2030 and its Sustainable Development Goals into EU policies.\nIn June 2022, the Commission published a review of its Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) policy.\nEU trade policy and sustainable development\nEU law requires all relevant EU policies, including trade policy, to promote sustainable development. EU trade policy aims to ensure that economic development goes hand in hand with:\n\nsocial justice;\nrespect for human rights;\nhigh labour standards, and;\nhigh environmental standards.\n\nThe EU strives to ensure trade policy helps promote sustainable development through:\n\nEU trade agreements;\nspecial incentives for developing countries, and;\ntrade and development policy.\n\nThe EU promotes sustainable development by addressing specific issues in EU trade policy:\nSustainable development in EU trade agreements\nTrade agreements are an important driver for sustainable growth both in the EU and in partner countries. Modern EU trade agreements contain rules on trade and sustainable development.\nMore on Sustainable development in EU trade agreements.\nEnvironmental protection\nThrough its trade policy the EU supports the implementation of international environmental rules, set mainly in multilateral environmental agreements.\nMore on Environmental protection.\nHuman rights\nThe EU's trade policy, alongside its foreign policy and development cooperation, supports respect for human rights in non-EU countries.\nMore on Human rights.\nLabour rights\nThe EU uses increased trade opportunities to promote improved labour standards while preventing a 'race to the bottom'.\nMore on Labour rights. \nSingle Entry Point\nThe EU contact point to communicate non-compliance with trade and sustainable development commitments.\nMore on the single entry point files\nResponsible business\nEU trade policy seeks to help ensure that companies produce their products responsibly, respecting workers and the environment.\nMore on Responsible business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on sustainable development\n\n\n2022 Comparative study of trade and sustainable development provisions in trade agreements\n2021 FTA Implementation Report\n2020 FTA Implementation Report\n2020 Commission Staff Working Document 'Individual reports and info sheets on implementation of EU Free Trade Agreements'\n2019 FTA Implementation Report\n2019 Commission Staff Working Document 'Individual reports and info sheets on implementation of EU Free Trade Agreements'\n2018 FTA Implementation Report\n2018 Commission Staff Working Document 'Individual reports and info sheets on implementation of EU Free Trade Agreements'\nFact sheet on EU cooperation with ILO\nTrade, Growth and Development Implementation Report\n10 Ways the EU Trade and Development Policy supports the LDCs\nTSD Handbook: Implementation of the Chapter on Trade and Sustainable Development in the Trade Agreement between EU and Ecuador\n\nSustainable development in other Commission departments\n\nEnvironment\nClimate Action\nEmployment, Social Affairs and Inclusion\nInternational Partnerships\n\nOther resources\n\nWorld Trade Organization – Trade and Environment\nInternational Labour Organization\nUnited Nations Environment Programme\nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsGeneral publications18 February 2025Prior information notice: Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment in support of Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations between the EU and ThailandEC-TRADE/2025/OP/0002: Trade Sustainability Impact Assessment in support of Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations between the EU and ThailandGeneral publications3 February 2025Call for tender: Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) and Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) Compliance Support FacilityEC-TRADE/2024/OP/0024: Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) and Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) Compliance Support Facility1 min readNews article12 December 2024EU and US host Minerals Security Partnership Forum workshop on critical minerals supply chainsToday, the EU, the United States and other stakeholders in the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) participated in a workshop on public-private Investment in critical minerals.2 min readSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest eventsPartner meetingsCSD on the impact of EU FTAs on key environmental aspects, including climateTuesday 25 February 2025, 09:00 - 11:00 (CET)Brussels, BelgiumLive streaming availablePartner meetings11th meeting of the EU-Andean Civil Society ForumThursday 28 November 2024, 14:00 - 17:30 (CET)Partner meetingsFourth meeting of the EU-Vietnam Joint Forum on TSD under the EVFTAThursday 21 November 2024, 09:00 - 11:00 (CET)Live streaming availableSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If this is not possible, WTO Members can request the establishment of a panel to settle the dispute. The panel will issue a report, which can subsequently be appealed before the WTO's Appellate Body on questions of law.\nThe Appellate Body is a standing body of seven persons that hears appeals from reports issued by panels in disputes brought by WTO members. The Appellate Body can uphold, modify or reverse the legal findings and conclusions of a panel\nIf a WTO member does not comply with recommendations from dispute settlement, than trade compensation or sanctions, for example in the form of increases in customs duties, may follow.\nMany WTO members, including the EU, make active use of this system so that violations of trade rules are corrected. However, the EU only initiates a dispute settlement case where other ways of finding a solution have not been productive.\n\nWTO disputes - Cases involving the EU\n\nThe Appellate Body crisis\nSince 11 December 2019, the Appellate Body is no longer able to deliver binding resolutions of trade disputes. Nor can it guarantee the right to appellate review. New appointments to the WTO's Appellate Body are blocked.\nThe EU is engaging in efforts to resolve this situation.\n\nEU Proposal to the WTO to amend the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU)\nEU Statement of 9 December 2019\nEU Statement of 15 and 16 October 2019\n\nThe EU has been supportive of the informal process under the auspices of the WTO General Council led by New Zealand Ambassador David Walker, who chairs the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\nMulti-party interim appeal arbitration arrangement\nPending a resolution of the Appellate Body situation, the EU and other WTO members established a Multi-party interim appeal arbitration arrangement (MPIA). The MPIA became effective on 30 April 2020 and ensures that the participating WTO members continue to benefit from a functioning two-step dispute settlement system in the WTO, including the availability of an independent and impartial appeal stage. Any WTO member may join.\nThe MPIA builds on previous bilateral interim-appeal arrangements concluded between the EU, Canada and Norway.\nOn 30 July 2020, MPIA members established a pool of appeal arbitrators who will hear appeals of WTO panel reports under the MPIA.\nIn March 2021, over 50 WTO members were participating in the MPIA:\nThe EU, including its Member States; Australia; Benin; Brazil; Canada; China; Chile; Colombia; Costa Rica; Ecuador; Guatemala; Hong Kong SAR; Iceland; Macao SAR; Mexico; Montenegro; New Zealand; Nicaragua; Norway; Pakistan; Peru; Singapore; Switzerland; Ukraine; and Uruguay.\nEnforcement Regulation\nAnother line of defence for the EU given the WTO situation is the Enforcement Regulation. It permits the European Commission to act on the EU's behalf in certain situations to respond to trade actions by partner countries.\nThe Enforcement Regulation also permits the EU to act should a third country block effective settlement in WTO disputes or in bilateral disputes.\nWTO reform\nThe EU is working to reform the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism to ensure that it maintains its effectiveness.\nThe reform aims to:\n\nMake it easier to negotiate new agreements to respond to important trade issues. ‘Plurilateral’ agreements bringing together all WTO members who want to move forward on a given issue would stop those who do not from blocking progress. Such agreements would be open to all WTO members and could be integrated into the WTO’s framework of rules later.\nFind, together with the entire WTO membership, a lasting solution to the current Appellate Body situation that would restore fully functional dispute settlement at the WTO.\nMake the WTO’s monitoring of its members’ trade policies more effective by improving the transparency of members’ trade practices and improving how WTO committees work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article10 January 2025WTO confirms validity of EU climate-based actions in renewable energy dispute brought by IndonesiaIn a ruling published today, the World Trade Organization (WTO) upheld the EU’s ability to take environmental and climate-based action under the Renewable Energy Directive (‘RED II’).2 min readPress release25 November 2024Commission challenges China’s anti-dumping tariffs on EU brandy at the WTOToday the European Commission has formally requested consultations at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over the provisional anti-dumping measures imposed by China on imports of EU brandy.1 min readNews article14 November 2024EU takes further action in Colombia frozen fries disputeToday, the EU has taken further steps to challenge Colombia’s tariffs on EU frozen fries by requesting the establishment of a compliance panel at the World Trade Organization (WTO).

The EU is also negotiating to establish a Multilateral Investment Court.More information on Investment disputes.Candidates for dispute settlement activitiesBilateral dispute settlement proceedings under the EU’s trade agreements with third countries depend on highly qualified adjudicators. The EU’s selection process establishes independently vetted pools of eligible candidates, ensuring the prompt and precise adjudication of disputes arising under EU trade agreements.The candidates that pass the selection process are included in a pool, from which the Commission may choose individuals to be nominated for appointment in specific disputes or proposed for rosters, courts or tribunals under specific agreements. For rosters, courts or tribunals, the final appointments will be decided by agreement with the third country concerned after the Council has adopted a decision pursuant to Article 218(9) TFEU.European Commission publishes pool of individuals eligible for appointment arbitrators and TSD experts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article10 January 2025WTO confirms validity of EU climate-based actions in renewable energy dispute brought by IndonesiaIn a ruling published today, the World Trade Organization (WTO) upheld the EU’s ability to take environmental and climate-based action under the Renewable Energy Directive (‘RED II’).2 min readPress release25 November 2024Commission challenges China’s anti-dumping tariffs on EU brandy at the WTOToday the European Commission has formally requested consultations at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over the provisional anti-dumping measures imposed by China on imports of EU brandy.1 min readNews article14 November 2024EU takes further action in Colombia frozen fries disputeToday, the EU has taken further steps to challenge Colombia’s tariffs on EU frozen fries by requesting the establishment of a compliance panel at the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Due to the high degree of integration within the EU, foreign direct investment* in one Member State could pose risks to security or public order in another Member State, or in the whole Union.Stepping up information sharing and cooperation in the EU is necessary to identify new challenges and to react accordingly. For that purpose, the new framework:creates a cooperation mechanism where Member States and the Commission are able to exchange information and raise concerns related to specific investments;allows the Commission to issue opinions when an investment threatens the security or public order of more than one Member State, or when an investment could undermine a strategic project or programme of interest to the whole EU, such as Horizon 2020 or Galileo;encourages international cooperation on investment screening, including sharing experience, best practices and information on issues of common concern;sets certain requirements for Member States that wish to maintain or adopt a screening mechanism at national level (Member States also have the last word on whether or not a specific investment operation should be allowed on their territory), and;takes into account the need to operate under short business-friendly deadlines and strong confidentiality requirements.Factsheet on the EU investment screening regulationTo improve the functioning of the cooperation mechanism set up by the EU investment screening framework, the services of the Commission, at the initiative of DG Trade, have developed a form for providing information to be submitted under the cooperation mechanism (the form is also available in a format that complies with web accessibility standards).The use of this form speeds up the examination by the 26 recipient Member States and the Commission and enables the notifying Member State to finalise its investigation without delay.*'Foreign direct investment' means investments of any kind by a foreign investor aiming to establish or to maintain lasting and direct links between the foreign investor and the entrepreneur to whom or the undertaking to which the capital is made available in order to carry on an economic activity in a Member State, including investments which enable effective participation in the management or control of a company carrying out an economic activity. Revision of the FDI Screening RegulationOn 24 January 2024, the Commission adopted five initiatives to strengthen the EU’s economic security at a time of growing geopolitical tensions and profound technological shifts. One of these initiatives concerns further strengthening the protection of EU security and public order by proposing improved screening of foreign investment into the EU.This legislative proposal builds on the experience gained by the Commission and Member States with reviewing over 1,200 FDI transactions notified by Member States over the previous three years under the existing FDI Screening Regulation. It also builds on an extensive evaluation of the functioning of the current regulation and a recent report of the European Court of Auditors.The legislative proposal aims to address existing shortcomings and improves the efficiency of the system by:Ensuring that all Member States have a screening mechanism in place, with better harmonised national rules.Identifying minimum sectoral scope where all Member States must screen foreign investments.Extending EU screening to investments by EU investors that are ultimately controlled by individuals or businesses from a non-EU country.Factsheet - Proposal for a new regulation on the screening of foreign investmentsScreening mechanisms of Member StatesUnder the regulation, Member States may maintain their existing screening mechanisms, adopt new ones, or remain without such national mechanisms.The Commission calls on those Member States that currently do not have a screening mechanism, or whose screening mechanisms do not cover all relevant FDI transactions or do not allow screening before investments are made, to urgently set up a comprehensive FDI screening mechanism. In the meantime, it calls on such Member States to use other suitable legal instruments to address cases where the acquisition or control of a particular business, infrastructure or technology would create a risk to security or public order in the EU.The Commission calls on those Member States that are in the process of setting up such a screening mechanism to accelerate its adoption and prepare its implementation, including by supporting it with appropriate resources.The regulation does provide for some key requirements for national screening mechanisms:transparency of rules and procedures;non-discrimination among foreign investors;confidentiality of information exchanged;the possibility of recourse against screening decisions, and;measures to identify and prevent circumvention by foreign investors.On the basis of notifications by Member States pursuant to the regulation, the Commission publishes an up-to-date list of screening laws in the EU.Consult the list of screening mechanisms notified by Member StatesAnnual reportsThe regulation requires the Commission to submit a report on the implementation of the regulation to the European Parliament and to the Council on a yearly basis.The Commission’s fourth 'Report on the Screening of Foreign Direct Investments into the Union' was adopted on 17 October 2024. The report includes:figures and trends for FDI into the EU;legislative developments in Member States;screening activities by Member States, and;an assessment of the EU cooperation mechanism on FDI screening in 2023.The report also has a Staff Working Document with more economic data on foreign investments as well as additional details on the legislative developments in all Member States.Fourth annual report on the screening of foreign direct investments into the Union (2023)Annual reports on the screening of foreign direct investments into the Union Group of experts on screening foreign direct investmentThe Commission in 2017 established a group of experts from Member States. The objective of the group is to discuss issues relating to investment screening, share best practices and lessons learned, and exchange views on trends and issues of common concern relating to foreign investments. Pursuant to Article 12 of the new regulation, the group may also discuss systemic issues relating to the implementation of the regulation.Commission Decision of 29.11.2017 setting up the group of experts on the screening of foreign direct investments into the European Union C(2017)7866 finalRegister of Commission Expert GroupsData protection under the EU investment screening mechanismJoint Controllership Arrangement (JCA)Under the EU cooperation mechanism set up by the FDI Screening Regulation, Member States and the Commission exchange information about foreign direct investments. This may involve the processing of personal data (e.g. names and addresses of natural persons involved in a transaction).Hence, the Member States and the Commission have concluded a Joint Controllership Arrangement (JCA) in line with data protection rules, notably the GDPR (Article 26), the EDPR (Article 28) and the EU FDI Screening Regulation (Article 14) and the underlying Commission Decision. The JCA is an agreement between Member States and the Commission on the processing of these personal data. It sets out the allocation of the respective roles, responsibilities and practical arrangements between Member States and the Commission: both being joint controllers of these data.The document entered into force on 28 April 2022. The main elements of the JCA are available in the EU Register of the Data Protection Officer (DPO).Privacy statement on protecting and processing personal data in the context of implementing the EU's Investment Screening RegulationCommission Decision (EU) 2020/1502 of 15 October 2020 laying down internal rules concerning the provision of information to data subjects and the restriction of certain of their rights in the context of the processing of personal data by the Commission in the cooperation mechanism established by Regulation (EU) 2019/452 of the European Parliament and of the CouncilJoint Controllership Arrangement with regard to processing of personal data in the context of the cooperation mechanism under Regulation (EU) 2019/452 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 March 2019 establishing a framework for the screening of foreign direct investments into the UnionInternational cooperation on investment screeningThe regulation encourages Member States and the Commission to cooperate with the responsible authorities of like-minded third countries on issues relating to the screening of foreign direct investments on grounds of security and public order.Such administrative cooperation should aim to strengthen the effectiveness of the framework for screening of investment by Member States and the cooperation between Member States and the Commission. The EU pursues international cooperation bilaterally or in a wider format.In particular, the EU is supporting the ongoing work of the OECD on Investment policies related to national security and public order.Since 2021, cooperation with the US on investment screening is also ongoing in Working Group 8 of the Trade and Technology Council (TTC). Stakeholders may provide inputs on Futurium, which is a virtual space for businesses, public authorities, innovators, researchers, civil society, and policymakers to shape the EU and US discussions in the Trade and Technology Council together.EU-US Trade and Technology Council Inaugural Joint Statement (Pittsburgh, 29 September 2021)Website of the TTC Investment Screening Working Group on FuturiumMore on Investment screening2022 OECD Report assessing the framework for screening foreign direct investment into the EU2022 Guidance for Member States concerning foreign direct investment from Russia and Belarus in view of the military aggression against Ukraine and the restrictive measures laid down in recent Council Regulations on sanctions.2020 Guidance for Member States on how to use foreign direct investment (FDI) screening in times of public health crisis and economic vulnerability in the EU2019 Study on the foreign ownership of EU firms2017 Communication on Welcoming Foreign Direct Investment while Protecting Essential Interests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsPress release15 January 2025Commission calls on Member States to review outbound investments and assess risks to economic securityThe Commission has today published a Recommendation calling on EU Member States to review outbound investments of their companies into non-EU countries.

The objective is to deter coercion, and if necessary, to respond to it.\nUnder the regulation, ‘economic coercion' refers to a situation whereby a third country seeks to pressure the European Union or an EU Member State into making a particular choice by applying, or threatening to apply, measures affecting trade or investment.\nSuch practices unduly interfere with the legitimate sovereign choices of the European Union and its Member States.\nWhether a third-country measure fulfils those conditions will be determined on a case-by-case basis.\nEconomic coercion directed against the European Union or an EU Member State may affect any policy field and may take the form of legislation, or other formal or informal action or inaction. The instrument and the EU’s policy apply irrespective of the source of the coercion, and thus irrespective of the identity of the third country.\nEU action under the Anti-Coercion Instrument\nThe regulation sets out a framework for EU action against economic coercion, in line with public international law, and sets out a number of procedures to be followed, including timelines.\nExamination\nFollowing a request or on its own initiative, the European Commission first examines the existence of economic coercion in an individual case. \nAny actor affected by or concerned about potential coercion may submit to the Commission information on incidents of economic coercion, or a duly substantiated request for examination of a third-country measure, here. The Commission will ensure the protection of any confidential information which may be submitted. \nThe Commission is required to act expeditiously and should complete the examination as soon as possible, normally within four months.\nDetermination\nFollowing a formal proposal from the Commission, the Council determines the existence of economic coercion via an implementing act. The Council should act expeditiously. It has a maximum of 8 to 10 weeks to complete this step. Once coercion has been determined, the Commission requests the coercing third country to stop the coercion.\nEngagement\nOn behalf of the EU, the Commission will engage in consultations with the coercing third country with a view to resolving the issue, provided that the third country engages in good faith. The EU would explore appropriate avenues such as direct negotiations, mediations, arbitration, good offices, and adjudication.\nResponse measures\nIf those efforts do not bear fruit, and in view of set deadlines, the Commission may, as a last resort, adopt EU response measures to counteract the coercion, with a view to inducing the third country to stop its coercion.\nThe types of measure which the Commission may take include restrictions on the access to the EU market and other economic disadvantages for the third country involved. The list of options is broad, and covers areas such as trade in goods, services, foreign direct investment, financial markets, public procurement, trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, export controls, and more. The Commission acts by way of an implementing act, once Member States have given their views in an examination procedure.\nAdditionally, the Commission may deploy appropriate measures with regard to the granting of Union funding. For more information, see the Commission's Communication to the European Parliament and the European Council on the Commission’s proposal for an anti-coercion instrument.\nBefore the imposition of EU response measures, the Commission carries out consultations in order to select appropriate measures in individual cases, where applicable. Those concerned, such as economic operators, business associations, consumers, are encouraged to participate. The Member States’ views also inform the selection and design of any measure. Information in any specific case will be provided in the Official Journal of the EU, and on DG Trade's website.\nThe Commission terminates the Union response measures as soon as they are no longer needed.\nThe Union may also decide to request reparation for the injury caused by the economic coercion, in line with public international law.\nInternational cooperation\nThe EU cooperates with other countries affected by the same or similar coercive practices, in individual cases.\nAt all times, the EU engages with partners in efforts to address the issue of economic coercion more generally.  This engagement currently takes place at the G7 (see G7 Hiroshima Leaders’ Communiqué and G7 Leaders’ Statement on Economic Resilience and Economic Security of 20 May 2023), and also bilaterally, with for example the United States and Japan.\nSingle point of contact\nA single point of contact is available for any stakeholder interested in the application of this regulation.\nFurther information\n\nAnti-Coercion Instrument (legislative text): Regulation 2023/2675 on the protection of the European Union and its Member States from economic coercion\nPress Release: New tool to enable EU to withstand economic coercion enters into force (27 December 2023)\nQ&A \nRelated statements and documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTune in to trade policy insights19 December 2024Episode 10Tom Moylan meets the new Trade and Economic Security Commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, to discuss Mercosur, tariffs, and trust.19/12/2024 | Episode 10 | 29 minutes14 November 2024Episode 9Do you care about where our goods come from?

(This is because they belong to the European Economic Area, and have adopted European Community legislation in most areas, making them part of the single market.)\nConfidentiality\nConfidential information will not be revealed without permission of the party that supplied it. However, a non-confidential summary of the complaint must be provided for distribution to interested parties, to ensure that they can defend their rights.\nDeadline for action\nIf a complaint is accepted, the investigation must be initiated within 45 days after the complaint is lodged with the Commission. The anti-dumping investigation will determine whether action should be taken (e.g. imposition of an anti-dumping duty).\nFurther guidance\n\nHow to draft an anti-dumping complaint (available in all official EU languages)\nContact us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article11 April 2025EU takes action against dumped imports of food flavour enhancer The European Commission has extended its anti-dumping measures on imports of monosodium glutamate (MSG) from China, to cover imports from Malaysia.1 min readNews article25 March 2025Commission strengthens protection for EU steel industryThe European Commission has tightened the steel safeguard measure to shield the EU steel industry from surging imports, delivering on the EU's Steel and Metals Action Plan.1 min readNews article24 March 2025Commission starts tracking imports of industrial chemicals rapidly filling the EU marketThe Commission has started monitoring the import volumes of certain ethylene and ammonia products, which are mainly used for fertiliser production and industrial applications.1 min readSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest eventsPartner meetingsCivil Society Dialogue on the EU’s Trade defence instruments – Annual Report 2023Thursday 26 September 2024, 14:30 - 16:30 (CEST)Live streaming availablePartner meetingsCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2022Monday 25 September 2023, 11:00 - 13:00 (CEST)Online onlyLive streaming availablePartner meetingsCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2021Thursday 24 November 2022, 14:00 - 16:00 (CET)Online onlyLive streaming availableSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

However, interested parties may ask for a review during that time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade topicsAnti-dumpingTrade defence\n\n\n\nInterim review\nWhat is an interim review?\nAnti-dumping measures are usually imposed for five years. However, interested parties may ask for a review during that time:\n\nany exporter, importer or Community producer: once the measures have been in force for one year.\nan EU country or the Commission itself: at any time.\n\nAn interim review can be ‘full’ – covering dumping, injury and Community interest – or ‘partial’ – limited to dumping, for example.\nHow to ask for an interim review\nContact us in writing, stating the reasons for the review and providing sufficient evidence of the need for a review.\nFor example, an exporter may claim that its cost structure has changed due to new investments and that this has resulted in a reduced rate of dumping.\nIf a request for review is accepted, the Commission publishes a Notice of Initiation in the EU’s Official Journal and sends out questionnaires to interested parties, just as in the original investigation. The review must be concluded within 15 months.\nWhat aspects does an interim review cover?\nMost often the request concerns the level of the duty in force.\nFor instance, an exporter may claim that the amount of dumping has fallen. The duty would be recalculated only if the change is lasting and the dumping margin is not likely to increase again in future.\nOther forms of review can also be considered such as for injury, scope and form of measures.\nNew Exporter Review\nWhat is a new exporter review?\n\nAnti-dumping measures are usually imposed for five years.\nImports from companies that cooperated with the investigation are usually liable for their own individual duty, but there is also a 'country-wide' duty for imports from all other companies producing and exporting the product concerned to the EU, which will often be higher than the individual duty.\n\nIf a company starts exporting the product to the EU after the investigation, then its goods will be subject to the 'country-wide' duty.\nHow to ask for a new exporter review\nCompanies that either did not exist, or did not export to the EU during the original investigation, can request a new exporter review to have their own individual duty rate established.\nTo qualify as a 'new exporter', a company must fulfil these three criteria:\n\nIt did not export the product concerned to the EU during the original investigation period;\nit is not related to any exporter or producer subject to the measures imposed, and;\nit has exported the product to the EU since the original investigation, or is contractually bound (irrevocably) to export a significant quantity to the EU.\n\nIf a company appears to meet the above criteria, a review will be opened. The review will investigate whether the criteria are met and if so establish an individual margin of dumping for the company concerned. Specific rules apply when the applicable duty was established on the basis of a sample of exporting producers.\nInterested parties wishing to claim to be treated as a new exporter should contact us for more information on the procedure.\nAbsorption\nDuties are said to be absorbed when, after anti-dumping or countervailing duties have been imposed, export prices decrease or the resale prices of the imported goods do not increase sufficiently, so the measures do not have the expected effect.\nWhat is an anti-absorption re-investigation?\nWhen there is evidence of duties being absorbed, the original trade defence investigation may be re-opened at the request of any interested party (EU producer, exporter, importer, user), EU country or the Commission. The re-investigation is initiated by publishing a Notice in the EU’s Official Journal, normally within two years of the original measures being imposed. It should take no more than nine months to complete.\nWhat can be done?\nThe re-investigation gives exporters, importers, EU producers and users the opportunity to explain the export prices and EU resale prices. If the conclusion is that the duties should have resulted in price changes that did not take place, the dumping margins can be recalculated and the duties increased up to double the rate of the original duty.\nWhat law is applied here?\nArticle 12 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 19(3) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation.\nHow to proceed\nAny interested party EU industry, exporter, importer, user and which finds evidence of absorption of duties, can either lodge a complaint with the European Commission (Directorate General for Trade, Directorate H) or inform national authorities, who may ask for the investigation to be reopened.\nCircumvention of measures\nIn essence, circumvention is any activity designed to avoid the payment of anti-dumping or countervailing duties imposed on a particular product manufactured in and/or exported from a non-EU country.\nThese practices can best be understood through examples:\n\nslightly modifying a product so that it can be classified under a combined nomenclature (CN) code that is not subject to duties, or;\nfalsely declaring that a product originated in a country not subject to duties, or;\nexporting through a producer with a lower duty rate, or;\nexporting a product in parts and having it assembled in the EU, where the parts are not subject to duties, or;\ncertain assembly operations in non-EU countries.\n\nFor a practice to qualify as circumvention, there must also be evidence that:\n\nEU industry is being harmed or the duty’s effects are being undermined in terms of prices and/or quantities of the product in question, and;\nthere is evidence that the imported product is being dumped, or;\nevidence that the imported product and/or parts thereof still benefit from the subsidy.\n\nWhen is assembly in the EU considered circumvention?\nThree criteria must be met:\n\nThe assembly began – or substantially increased – after or just before an anti-dumping investigation, and the parts imported into the EU come from the country subject to duties, and;\nThe imported parts represent 60% or more of the value of all parts of the assembled product. However, if the value added in the EU to the imported parts represents more than 25% of the manufacturing cost, this is no longer considered assembly and there is no circumvention, and;\nThe assembled product undermines the effects of the duty and there is evidence of dumping.\n\nThe same rules apply to assembly operations in non-EU countries.\nIf a company is circumventing the duties in force, what can be done?\nThe Commission may open an investigation if: \n\nan interested party provides sufficient evidence of circumvention, or;\nan EU country makes a request, and; \nthe Commission believes one is warranted.\n\nThe first step in an investigation is the publication of a Regulation in the EU’s Official Journal. Customs authorities will then begin registering all imports alleged to be circumventing the measures. This enables them to impose a duty retroactively, should circumvention be found.\nWhat is the result of the investigation?\nIf it is determined that circumvention has taken place, the duties in force will be extended to imports from the country or company found to be circumventing them. The duties then apply retroactively from the date on which the investigation began.\nWhat about exporters in the country concerned that are not circumventing the duties?\nThe Regulation opening the investigation clearly states that companies not engaging in circumvention must contact the Commission by a specific deadline and provide information and evidence proving that they are not related to any producer subject to measures nor engaged in circumvention themselves.\nThe Commission can then propose that individual companies be exempted from registration of their imports and/or the extension of duties.\nIn the case of anti-dumping proceedings, when circumvention takes place in the EU, exemptions may be also granted to importers.\nExpiry review\nWhat is an expiry review?\nAnti-dumping measures are usually imposed for five years. They expire automatically, unless a review determines that if they were to expire, dumping and injury would probably continue or recur.\nThis 'expiry review' is usually requested by producers in the EU – although it can also be launched on the initiative of the Commission – and must include evidence that the expiry of measures would be likely to result in a continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury.\nThis can be demonstrated by evidence that:\n\ndumping and injury are continuing\nthe removal of injury is only due to the measures in force\nfurther dumping and injury are likely if the measures are allowed to expire.\n\nWhat is the procedure?\nDuring the final year the measures are in force, the Commission publishes a Notice of Impending Expiry in the EU’s Official Journal stating that they will expire on a given date. If EU producers wish to request a review, they must do so no later than three months before the date on which the measures are set to expire.\nIf a substantiated review request is received, the Commission publishes a Notice of Initiation and begins investigating whether dumping and injury are likely to continue or recur. Normally, expiry reviews are completed within 12 months, but they may take up to 15 months.\n\nThe guide 'How to make an anti-dumping complaint' (available in all official EU languages) contains a specific section giving guidance to EU industry on how to prepare an expiry review request.\nIf no review is requested, the Commission publishes a Notice of Expiry announcing that the measures will lapse.\nWhat can be the result?\nAn expiry review can result only in the repeal or continuation of the duties in force. If measures are maintained, they will normally remain in force for another five years. An expiry review cannot lead to a change in the level or form of the duties; these can only be changed by an interim review\nChanges of name, address or legal status for companies subject to an individual duty\nCompanies subject to an individual duty and mentioned by name in the operative part of an anti-dumping regulation – that change their name and/or address, should contact us immediately.\nIf the name and address details in the regulation imposing the measures are not identical to the name and address on the export documents, difficulties may arise with customs formalities.\nThe Commission will verify the data and inform the company if it needs more information. Details of the new name/address will be published in the EU’s Official Journal.\nCompanies undergoing a more complex structural change such as a merger or takeover should also contact us to determine whether the changes require a change of name or a partial interim review. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article11 April 2025EU takes action against dumped imports of food flavour enhancer The European Commission has extended its anti-dumping measures on imports of monosodium glutamate (MSG) from China, to cover imports from Malaysia.1 min readNews article25 March 2025Commission strengthens protection for EU steel industryThe European Commission has tightened the steel safeguard measure to shield the EU steel industry from surging imports, delivering on the EU's Steel and Metals Action Plan.1 min readNews article24 March 2025Commission starts tracking imports of industrial chemicals rapidly filling the EU marketThe Commission has started monitoring the import volumes of certain ethylene and ammonia products, which are mainly used for fertiliser production and industrial applications.1 min readSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest eventsPartner meetingsCivil Society Dialogue on the EU’s Trade defence instruments – Annual Report 2023Thursday 26 September 2024, 14:30 - 16:30 (CEST)Live streaming availablePartner meetingsCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2022Monday 25 September 2023, 11:00 - 13:00 (CEST)Online onlyLive streaming availablePartner meetingsCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2021Thursday 24 November 2022, 14:00 - 16:00 (CET)Online onlyLive streaming availableSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The duties are imposed when the products in question are imported from the non-EU country(ies).\nThe rate of duty for each case is based on the dumping margin, unless a lower rate would remove the injury ('lesser duty rule').\nWith regard to anti-dumping duties, the EU may choose to impose one or more of three basic forms:\n\nad valorem duty – a percentage of the net, free-at-EU frontier (CIF) price. This is the most common form of duty;\nspecific duty – a fixed value for a certain amount of goods, e.g. €100 per tonne of a product, and/or;\nvariable duty – a minimum import price (MIP). Importers in the EU do not pay an anti-dumping duty if the foreign exporter’s export price to the EU is higher than the MIP.\n\nUpon request from individual exporters, a company-specific price undertaking may also be accepted. This is a commitment by an exporter to respect minimum import prices (MIPs). This commitment is not meant to fix prices at specific levels, rather to prevent them from falling below a certain floor price. To avoid any restriction of fair competition, the content of such undertakings is not made public.\nPrice undertakings are governed by Article 8 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation (which draws on Article 8 of the WTO anti-dumping Agreement).\nOnce the Commission accepts an undertaking, the company’s products are exempt from anti-dumping duties that would otherwise be charged when they are entered for free circulation.\nPrice undertakings are closely monitored by the Commission.\nSpecial rules for developing countries are contained in Article 15 of the WTO Anti-dumping agreement and for EU candidate countries in the Essen Declaration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article11 April 2025EU takes action against dumped imports of food flavour enhancer The European Commission has extended its anti-dumping measures on imports of monosodium glutamate (MSG) from China, to cover imports from Malaysia.1 min readNews article25 March 2025Commission strengthens protection for EU steel industryThe European Commission has tightened the steel safeguard measure to shield the EU steel industry from surging imports, delivering on the EU's Steel and Metals Action Plan.1 min readNews article24 March 2025Commission starts tracking imports of industrial chemicals rapidly filling the EU marketThe Commission has started monitoring the import volumes of certain ethylene and ammonia products, which are mainly used for fertiliser production and industrial applications.1 min readSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest eventsPartner meetingsCivil Society Dialogue on the EU’s Trade defence instruments – Annual Report 2023Thursday 26 September 2024, 14:30 - 16:30 (CEST)Live streaming availablePartner meetingsCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2022Monday 25 September 2023, 11:00 - 13:00 (CEST)Online onlyLive streaming availablePartner meetingsCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2021Thursday 24 November 2022, 14:00 - 16:00 (CET)Online onlyLive streaming availableSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The normal value is either the product's price as sold on the home market of the non-EU company, or a price based on the cost of production and profit.\n\nLatest Official Journal publications\n\nInvestigating injurious dumping\nThe European Commission is responsible for investigating dumping claims and imposing measures.\nThe Commission opens an investigation if it has sufficient evidence that imports into the EU are made at dumped prices and are causing injury to European industry.\nTypically, such evidence is communicated to the Commission by the European producers  exposed to the unfair competition of dumped imports (or jointly by trade unions and European industry) by means of an official complaint.\n\nConditions for making a complaint\nHow to draft an anti-dumping complaint (available in all offiicial EU languages)\n\nIn special circumstances, the Commission may also initiate an investigation on its own initiative, i.e. without having received a complaint. This is commonly referred to as an ‘ex officio’ initiation. \nWhile not based on a formal complaint, an ‘ex officio’ initiation is subject to the same legal and evidential requirements as those applicable to complaints. Thus the Commission may only initiate an investigation on its own motion if it has sufficient evidence of dumped imports causing injury to European industry.\nSuch evidence is normally only available to the European producers concerned. It requires knowledge and evidence that imports of a specific product would be dumped and, more critically, access to detailed business proprietary data relating to the performance of an industry at the level of that specific product.\nTherefore ‘ex officio’ investigations are in practice limited to circumstances where the parameters of a case (e.g. definition of the product scope and the relevant information on the situation faced by the affected European producers) are already established.\nA typical example is the initiation of anti-circumvention investigations. Via its monitoring of existing measures, the Commission may become aware of practices that result in the evasion of anti-dumping measures. In such circumstances, the Commission initiates ‘ex officio’ anti-circumvention investigations without awaiting a formal request from the European producers concerned.\nShould you wish to know more about this topic, you may contact the European Commission's anti-dumping service.\nThe anti-dumping investigation\nThe Commission opens an anti-dumping proceeding (investigation) by publishing a notice in the EU's Official Journal.\nThe investigation checks:\n\nwhether there is dumping by the producers in the country/countries concerned;\nwhether the European industry concerned suffers 'material injury';\nwhether there is a causal link between dumping and injury, and;\nwhether putting measures in place is not against the European interest.\n\nOnly when all four conditions are met can the Commission put anti-dumping measures in place.\nThe time limit for the Commission's investigation is 14 months. The results are then published in the Official Journal.\n\nThe full conditions for putting an anti-dumping measure in place.\nMain stages of an anti-dumping investigation\nFlowchart of a typical anti-dumping investigation\n\nAlternative dumping calculation methodology\nSince December 2017, the EU has an alternative method to calculate dumped imports if state interference significantly distorts the economy of the exporting country.\nIn this case, the Commission will use undistorted benchmarks to determine the 'normal value' of the product. This can apply to all WTO Members where significant market distortions are found.\n\nCommission memo on how it calculates state-distorted dumping \n\nTo show that distortions exist, the Commission examines all evidence in any case, including that contained in country-specific reports. \n\nCountry report on China\nCountry report on Russia\n\nAnti-dumping measures\nAnti-dumping measures can be put on imports of specific products if the Commission's anti-dumping investigation justifies it.\nThese measures are usually in the form of an 'ad valorem' duty. Other measures that can be applied include a fixed or specific amount of duty or, in some cases, a minimum import price.\nPrice undertakings may also be accepted instead of anti-dumping duties. This is where the exporter agrees not sell products in the EU at prices below a minimum amount. \nIf the Commission agrees to an undertaking, then the anti-dumping duties will not be collected on those imports. The Commission is not obliged to accept an offer of an undertaking.\nThe importer in the EU pays the duties and the national customs authority of the EU country collects them. The Commission monitors measures to make sure they are effective and respected by exporters and importers.\nTypes of trade defence measure\nThe way forward on anti-dumping\nAn anti-dumping investigation can be initiated in response to a complaint lodged by European manufacturers affected by dumped imports or at the request of an EU country.\nEU producers that are considering lodging an anti-dumping complaint should contact us.\nReviewing anti-dumping measures\nMeasures are generally in place for five years and may be reviewed if, for example:\n\nthe circumstances of the exporters have changed, or;\na new non-EU company starts exporting to the EU and requests the calculation of its own dumping margin.\n\nMeasures end after five years unless the Commission does an expiry review.\n\nHow to ask for a review\n\nRefunding anti-dumping duties\nImporters may request a full or partial refund of duties paid when they can show that they have paid duties in excess of the actual dumping margin prevailing for their non EU-supplier.\n\nHow to apply for a refund\n\nMore information\n\nThe EU's basic Anti-dumping Regulation\n\n2017 amendment\nCodified basic anti-dumping regulation\n\n\nThis regulation meets the rules in the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement.\nAnnual Reports on EU trade defence actions\nTrade defence contacts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article11 April 2025EU takes action against dumped imports of food flavour enhancer The European Commission has extended its anti-dumping measures on imports of monosodium glutamate (MSG) from China, to cover imports from Malaysia.1 min readNews article25 March 2025Commission strengthens protection for EU steel industryThe European Commission has tightened the steel safeguard measure to shield the EU steel industry from surging imports, delivering on the EU's Steel and Metals Action Plan.1 min readNews article24 March 2025Commission starts tracking imports of industrial chemicals rapidly filling the EU marketThe Commission has started monitoring the import volumes of certain ethylene and ammonia products, which are mainly used for fertiliser production and industrial applications.1 min readSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest eventsPartner meetingsCivil Society Dialogue on the EU’s Trade defence instruments – Annual Report 2023Thursday 26 September 2024, 14:30 - 16:30 (CEST)Live streaming availablePartner meetingsCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2022Monday 25 September 2023, 11:00 - 13:00 (CEST)Online onlyLive streaming availablePartner meetingsCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2021Thursday 24 November 2022, 14:00 - 16:00 (CET)Online onlyLive streaming availableSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If circumstances change, however, interested parties may ask for a review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade topicsAnti-subsidyTrade defenceTrade policy\n\n\n\nInterim review\nWhat is an interim review?\nCountervailing measures are usually imposed for five years. If circumstances change, however, interested parties may ask for a review:\n\nEU countries and the Commission: at any time\nany exporter, importer, authorities of an exporting country or EU producer concerned: only after the measures have been in force for one year.\n\nAn interim review can cover subsidisation, injury and Community interest (full interim review), or be limited to just one aspect, e.g. subsidisation (partial interim review).\nInterim review procedure\nTo request an interim review, contact the Commission in writing, stating the reasons for the review and providing prima facie evidence substantiating the need for it.\nIf the Commission accepts the request, it will then publish a Notice of Initiation in the EU’s Official Journal and send out questionnaires to interested parties, just as in the original investigation. A review should be concluded within 12 months – 15 months at most.\nWhat is looked at in a review?\nThis depends on the reason for the review. Often the request concerns the level of the duty in force – an exporter or the government of the exporting country may claim that the amount of subsidy has fallen, for example, in which case the subsidy margin is recalculated for a new investigation period.\nThe Commission will also investigate whether or not the change in circumstances is lasting. If it is not, then the duty rate would not normally be changed. Similar considerations would apply if the government of the exporting country claimed that the subsidy had been abolished altogether.\nInterested parties wishing to request a review should contact us providing prima facie evidence of their claim.\nNew Exporter Review\nWhat is a new exporter review?\n\nAnti-subsidy measures are usually imposed for five years.\nImports from companies that cooperated with the investigation are usually liable for their own individual duty, but there is also a 'country-wide' duty for imports from all other companies producing and exporting the product concerned to the EU, which will often be higher than the individual duty.\n\nIf a company starts exporting the product to the EU after the investigation, then its goods will be subject to the 'country-wide' duty.\nCompanies that either did not exist, or did not export to the EU during the original investigation, can request a new exporter review to have their own individual duty rate established.\nTo qualify as a 'new exporter', a company must not have been individually investigated during the original investigation for reasons other than a refusal to cooperate.\nIf a company appears to meet this criterion, a review will be opened.\nInterested parties wishing to claim to be treated as a new exporter should contact us for more information on the procedure.\nAbsorption\nDuties are said to be absorbed when, after anti-dumping or countervailing duties have been imposed, export prices decrease or the resale prices of the imported goods do not increase sufficiently, so the measures do not have the expected effect.\nWhat is an anti-absorption re-investigation?\nWhen there is evidence of duties being absorbed, the original trade defence investigation may be re-opened at the request of any interested party (EU producer, exporter, importer, user), EU country or the Commission.\nThe re-investigation is initiated by publishing a Notice in the EU’s Official Journal, normally within two years of the original measures being imposed. It should take no more than nine months to complete.\nWhat can be done?\nThe re-investigation gives exporters, importers, EU producers and users the opportunity to explain the export prices and EU resale prices. If the conclusion is that the duties should have resulted in price changes that did not take place, the dumping margins can be recalculated and the duties increased up to double the rate of the original duty.\nWhat law is applied here?\nArticle 12 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 19(3) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation.\nHow to proceed\nAny interested party (EU industry, exporter, importer, user) which finds evidence of absorption of duties can either lodge a complaint with the European Commission (Directorate General for Trade, Directorate H) or inform national authorities, who may ask for the investigation to be reopened.\nCircumvention\nWhat is circumvention?\nIn essence, circumvention is any activity designed to avoid the payment of countervailing duties imposed on a particular product manufactured in and/or exported from a non-EU country.\nThese practices can best be understood through examples:\n\nslightly modifying a product so that it can be classified under a combined nomenclature (CN) code that is not subject to duties\nfalsely declaring that a product originated in a country not subject to duties\nexporting through a producer with a lower duty rate\nexporting a product in parts and having it assembled in the EU, where the parts are not subject to duties.\n\nFor a practice to qualify as circumvention, there must also be evidence that:\n\nEU industry is being harmed or the duty’s effects are being undermined in terms of prices and/or quantities of the product in question, and;\nevidence that the imported product and/or parts thereof still benefit from the subsidy.\n\nIf a company is circumventing the duties in force, what can be done?\nThe Commission may open an investigation if sufficient evidence of circumvention is provided by:\n\nan interested party, or;\nan EU country, and;\nthe Commission believes one is warranted.\n\nThe first step in an investigation is the publication of a Regulation in the EU’s Official Journal. Customs authorities will then begin registering all imports alleged to be circumventing the measures. This enables them to impose a duty retroactively, should circumvention be found.\nWhat is the result of the investigation?\nIf it is determined that circumvention has taken place, the duties in force will be extended to imports from the country or company found to be circumventing them. The duties then apply retroactively from the date on which the investigation began.\nWhat about exporters in the country concerned that are not circumventing the duties?\nThe Regulation opening the investigation clearly states that companies not engaging in circumvention must contact the Commission by a specific deadline and provide information and evidence proving that they are not related to any producer subject to measures, nor engaged in circumvention themselves.\nThe Commission can then propose that individual companies be exempted from registration of their imports and/or the extension of duties. When circumvention takes place in the EU, exemptions may be also granted to importers.\nExpiry review\nWhat is an expiry review?\nCountervailing measures are normally imposed for a fixed period of five years. After that, they automatically expire unless a review demonstrates a need for them to be continued.\nAn 'expiry review' can be launched either at the request of producers in the EU, or on the initiative of the Commission. Any request for a review must be accompanied by evidence that the expiry of measures would be likely to result in a continuation or recurrence of subsidisation and injury, for example:\n\nevidence of continued subsidisation and injury;\nevidence that the removal of injury is only due to the measures in force, and/or;\nevidence that further subsidisation and injury is likely if the measures are repealed.\n\nWhat is the procedure?\nIn the final year of the measures, the Commission publishes a Notice of Impending Expiry in the EU’s Official Journal. Community producers may then request a review no later than three months before the measures are due to expire.\nIf no review request is received, the Commission publishes a Notice of Expiry announcing that the measures will lapse at the end of the five-year period.\nIf it receives a substantiated request for review, the Commission publishes a Notice of Initiation of an expiry review and starts an investigation to examine both subsidisation and injury. An expiry review should normally be completed within 12 months – 15 months at most.\nFollowing an expiry review, the duties are either repealed or maintained – in which case they will normally remain in force for a further five years. An expiry review cannot lead to a change in the level or form of duty – this can be accomplished only through an interim review.\nChanges of name, address or legal status for companies subject to an individual duty\nCompanies subject to an individual duty and mentioned by name in the operative part of an anti-dumping regulation and that change their name and/or address should contact us immediately.\nIf the name and address details in the regulation imposing the measures are not identical to the name and address on the export documents, difficulties may arise with customs formalities. The Commission will verify the data and inform the company if it needs more information.

The EU can impose duties to counteract a subsidy, but only if it is limited to a specific firm, industry, or group of firms or industries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade topicsAnti-subsidy\n\n\n\nA subsidy is a financial contribution made by (or on behalf of) a government or a public body that gives the recipient a benefit.Some subsidies are used to pursue domestic or social policies, for example supporting industries that help create new jobs. However, unfair subsidies can distort the EU market, create unfair competition and therefore damage European industry.The EU can impose duties to counteract a subsidy, but only if it is limited to a specific firm, industry, or group of firms or industries. Export subsidies, and subsidies based on using domestic goods over imported ones, are specific.EU anti-subsidy rulesDatabase of all subsidies investigated by the EU in its anti-subsidy investigationsThis document is for information purposes only and is no way binding on the Commission and the European Union. Only the text of the relevant Regulations as published in the Official Journal of the European Union is authentic and legally binding.Latest Official Journal publicationsTypes of subsidyThe recipient benefits when financial contributions are provided on more favourable terms than those available on the market.  A financial contribution can be:a direct or potential transfer of funds (e.g. grants, loans, equity injection or loan guarantees);government revenue abandoned or not collected (e.g. tax credits);a government providing goods and services, apart from infrastructure;a government purchasing goods and;any of the above done by a private company on the instruction of the government.  A specific subsidy is limited to a particular sector (e.g. ceramics or chemicals). A subsidy that is broadly available, like helping small businesses regardless of the industrial sector, is not considered specific.The EU's anti-subsidy investigationWhen an EU industry thinks that imports of a product from a non-EU country are subsidised and injuring the EU industry producing the same product, it can lodge a complaint with the Commission.Overview on lodging a complaintIf the complaint shows evidence of subsidy and injury, the Commission must open an anti-subsidy investigation.In special circumstances, the Commission may also initiate an investigation on its own initiative, i.e. without having received a complaint. This is commonly referred to as an ‘ex officio’ initiation. While not based on a formal complaint, an ‘ex officio’ initiation is subject to the same legal and evidential requirements as those applicable to complaints. Thus the Commission may only initiate an investigation on its own motion if it has sufficient evidence of subsidised imports causing injury to European industry.Such evidence is normally only available to the European producers concerned. It requires knowledge and evidence that imports of a specific product would be subsidised and, more critically, access to detailed business proprietary data relating to the performance of an industry at the level of that specific product.Therefore ‘ex officio’ investigations are in practice limited to circumstances where the parameters of a case (e.g. definition of the product scope and the relevant information on the situation faced by the affected European producers) are already established.A typical example is the initiation of anti-circumvention investigations. Via its monitoring of existing measures, the Commission may become aware of practices that result in the evasion of anti-subsidy measures. In such circumstances, the Commission initiates ‘ex officio’ anti-circumvention investigations without awaiting a formal request from the European producers concerned.The investigation checks if:the imports benefit from countervailable subsidies, including those identified in the complaint or discovered in the course of the investigation;the EU industry suffers material injury;there is a causal link between the injury and the subsidised imports, and;putting measures in place is in the European interest.Details of the anti-subsidy investigation procedureFlowchart of the anti-subsidy investigation processTypes of countervailing measuresCountervailing measures counteract the effects of subsidised imports on the EU market and restore fair competition. The measures can be:adding a percentage of the price to the goods;a fixed amount per unit;applying a minimum import price, or;a 'price undertaking', where the exporter commits to sell the product under investigation above a minimum price. In return, the Commission doesn't impose a duty.The Commission monitors import volumes and prices of all products subject to measures, to make sure the countervailing measures are working. It does so in close cooperation with:the customs authorities of EU countries;the Commission tax and customs department, and;the European fraud prevention agency (OLAF).The exporting country may also agree to remove or limit the unfair subsidy.Interim and expiry reviewsCountervailing measures lapse after five years. In that period, the Commission can conduct an interim review.  An interim review shall be initiated where the request contains sufficient evidence that the continued imposition of the measure is no longer necessary to offset the countervailable subsidy and/or that the injury would be unlikely to continue or recur if the measure were removed or varied, or that the existing measure is not, or is no longer, sufficient to counteract the countervailable subsidy which is causing injury.How to ask for an interim reviewIn the final year of measures, the EU producers may ask the Commission to conduct an expiry review. This review determines whether the expiry of the measures could lead to continued or recurring subsidisation and injury. If so, the measures may continue for another five years.How to request an expiry reviewImporters can also request a refund of the duties paid when they think that the amount of subsidy has been reduced or eliminated.How to ask for a refundMore on Anti-subsidyRegulation (EU) 2016/1037 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Union2017 amendmentCodified basic anti-subsidy regulationCommission Notice concerning the reimbursement of anti-dumping duties (2014/C 164/09)The EU's anti-subsidy rules are based on a 1994 WTO agreement which allows remedial action to be taken against subsidies that are considered an unfair trade practice.The Commission has also adopted guidelines for calculating the amount of a subsidy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article24 January 2025EU extends duties on electric bicycles from ChinaThe European Commission has published two Regulations extending anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of electric bicycles (e-bikes) from China for another five years.1 min readStatement8 November 2024Discussions on undertakings for electric vehicles in BeijingDiscussions between the EU and China on a possible agreement on price undertakings for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) took place in Beijing this week.1 min readPress release29 October 2024EU imposes duties on unfairly subsidised electric vehicles from China while discussions on price undertakings continueToday the European Commission concluded its anti-subsidy investigation by imposing definitive countervailing duties on imports of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) from China for a period of five years.See all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest eventsPartner meetingsCivil Society Dialogue on the EU’s Trade defence instruments – Annual Report 2023Thursday 26 September 2024, 14:30 - 16:30 (CEST)Live streaming availableSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

So far, safeguards have only been used sparingly by the EU.\nImports may also be subject to surveillance if the trend of imports of a product threatens to cause injury to EU producers.\nSurveillance does not restrict imports – it is a system of automatic import licensing over a limited time – either retroactively or in advance.\nAs of 15 May 2020, the prior surveillance regime has been replaced by a monitoring system.\nMore on Safeguards\n\nHow to make a safeguard complaint\nWhat are safeguard investigations?\nWhat are safeguard measures?\nWhat monitoring is there of safeguard measures?\n\nFor more on the legal basis of trade defence measures, see Legal basis\nEU\n\nEU Regulation 2015/478 – imports from WTO countries\nEU Regulation 2015/755 – imports from non-WTO countries\n\nInternational\n\nWTO agreement on safeguards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article11 April 2025EU takes action against dumped imports of food flavour enhancer The European Commission has extended its anti-dumping measures on imports of monosodium glutamate (MSG) from China, to cover imports from Malaysia.1 min readNews article25 March 2025Commission strengthens protection for EU steel industryThe European Commission has tightened the steel safeguard measure to shield the EU steel industry from surging imports, delivering on the EU's Steel and Metals Action Plan.1 min readNews article24 March 2025Commission starts tracking imports of industrial chemicals rapidly filling the EU marketThe Commission has started monitoring the import volumes of certain ethylene and ammonia products, which are mainly used for fertiliser production and industrial applications.1 min readSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest eventsPartner meetingsCivil Society Dialogue on the EU’s Trade defence instruments – Annual Report 2023Thursday 26 September 2024, 14:30 - 16:30 (CEST)Live streaming availablePartner meetingsCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2022Monday 25 September 2023, 11:00 - 13:00 (CEST)Online onlyLive streaming availablePartner meetingsCSD on the EU’s Trade Defence Instruments – Annual Report 2021Thursday 24 November 2022, 14:00 - 16:00 (CET)Online onlyLive streaming availableSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It affects all sectors of the economy and is highly important for European industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade topicsDigital trade\n\n\n\nDigital technologies increasingly enable trade. For example:banks rely heavily on the international transfer of data;agricultural commodity traders use e-signatures to conclude international purchases;manufacturers, freight operators and logistics enterprises can track and improve the performance of their machines and vehicles around the world thanks to electronic data transfers, and;everyday items increasingly combine sensors and internet-enabled applications, large datasets, and high-performance computing capabilities (‘Internet of Things’).The global e-commerce market is growing at a dynamic rate. In 2018, global e-commerce sales were estimated at more than €21 trillion, with around 1.5 billion people shopping online.Digital trade in the EU’s trade strategyThe growing importance of digital trade is reflected in the EU’s trade policy communication, An Open, Sustainable and Assertive Trade Policy, published in 2021.The communication provides that, “trade policy will play a vital role in attaining the EU’s objectives linked to the digital transition. European businesses rely on digital services, and this will only increase”.Against this backdrop, the EU has set itself ambitious goals. The communication states that, “supporting Europe’s digital agenda is a priority for EU trade policy. The objective is to ensure a leading position for the EU in digital trade and in the area of technology, most importantly by promoting innovation”.Digital trade in bilateral trade agreementsThe increasing importance the EU attaches to digital trade is reflected in its bilateral trade agreements. The EU’s approach to digital trade in its free trade agreements has gradually been adapted to respond to this growing strategic priority.Modern EU trade agreements contain a self-standing chapter on digital trade. The overarching goals of this chapter are:to ensure predictability and legal certainty for businesses;to ensure a secure online environment for consumers, and;to remove unjustified barriers.The digital trade chapter contains almost 20 binding provisions on a wide range of issues, including the following:banning customs duties on electronic transmissions (this does not forbid the imposition of internal taxes);promoting electronic contracts, electronic authentication methods and electronic trust services (such as e-signatures, e-seals and time stamps), which are necessary for the validation of online transactions and thus constitute a key enabler for digital trade;ensuring online consumer protection, including protection against spam;prohibiting unjustified government access to software source code;prohibiting unjustified barriers to data flows, including data localisation requirements and protecting privacy, and;facilitating regulatory cooperation.Digital Trade AgreementsThe EU also negotiates modern, self-standing digital trade agreements with key partner countries. The digital trade agreements aim to build consumer trust, ensure predictability and legal certainty for businesses, and remove and prevent the emergence of unjustified barriers to digital trade. They are also designed to help the parties to the agreements to develop and implement the policies required to address new challenges posed by the digital economy. The digital trade agreements demonstrate the EU's commitment to being at the forefront of new digital developments, while upholding open digital economies that are competitive, transparent, fair, and free of unjustified barriers to international trade.On 27 June 2023, the Council of the European Union authorised the Commission to open negotiations for digital trade agreements with Singapore and the Republic of Korea. These self-standing digital trade agreements should build on and complement the EU's existing trade frameworks with its partner countries.The negotiations also build on the cooperation and convergence in the Digital Partnerships and Digital Trade Principles that the EU has agreed with the Republic of Korea and Singapore. These negotiations reflect the strategic importance of digital trade and the pivotal role of the Southeast Asian region.   The digital trade agreements with the Republic of Korea and Singapore will put forward clear and binding rules, thereby enhancing the EU's synergies in the Indo-Pacific region: one of the most vibrant and forward-looking hubs of the digital transformation. These agreements will:unlock new markets;make electronic transactions easier; promote a safe online environment for consumers;create legal certainty for businesses;improve access to electronic commerce, and;facilitate digital trade.More on digital trade agreements Digital Trade PrinciplesThe EU has concluded Digital Partnerships with some of its partner countries to advance cooperation on several digital issues, including digital economy and trade, as well as trusted data flows and data innovation, standards, and the digital transformation of businesses and public services.The Digital Partnerships pave the way for cooperation in new and emerging areas with transformative economic potential for our economies. They also enable regulatory cooperation and common positions in international forums.The Digital Partnerships address digital trade and include Digital Trade Principles as an important deliverable. The Digital Trade Principles are non-binding instruments that reflect a common understanding on key issues relevant to digital trade and a joint commitment to an open digital economy, free of unjustified barriers to international trade.The Digital Trade Principles cover data governance (including free flow of data with trust, and open government data), digital trade facilitation (including paperless trading, single windows, electronic contracts, electronic authentication and electronic signatures, electronic invoicing), consumer trust (including online consumer protection and safety), and business trust (including open internet access, cybersecurity, and protection of source code and cryptography-related technology).They also provide a forum for cooperation on unjustified barriers to digital trade.EU and the Republic of Korea sign Digital Trade Principles, on 30 November 2022 (full text)EU and Singapore launch Digital Partnership, on 1 February 2023 (full text)The EU’s approach to ensuring free flow of dataData is the lifeblood of the digital economy. It is therefore vital that EU companies can move their data across borders.When negotiating trade agreements, the EU proposes the straightforward prohibition of protectionist barriers to cross-border data flows. At the same time, it ensures that trade agreements cannot be used to challenge existing and future EU law on the protection of personal data and privacy, which are fundamental rights in the EU.The EU’s approach to data flows is based on the premise that high standards of data protection and the facilitation of international trade can go hand–in-hand. Accordingly, the EU promotes a vision in which a high level of protection for privacy and personal data is a pre-condition for stable, secure and competitive global commercial flows in the digital world.The provisions negotiated by the EU in its trade agreements reflect this balanced approach.Digital trade in the World Trade OrganizationMultilateral rules are needed to develop a common, coherent approach that tackles global challenges effectively, fosters new opportunities, and encourages the expansion of digital trade (or 'e-commerce' as it is historically called in the WTO).During the 11th WTO Ministerial Conference, held in Buenos Aires in December 2017, a group of WTO Members decided to explore the opportunity to negotiate WTO rules on e-commerce. After a year of exploratory talks, plurilateral WTO negotiations on e-commerce were officially launched in January 2019. 86 WTO Members, including EU Member States, are currently engaged in these negotiations.The e-commerce negotiations in the WTO aim to:facilitate electronic transactions (e.g. e-contracts, e-signatures, e-payments);enhance consumer and business trust;address barriers related to cross-border data flows and data localisation requirements;protect computer source code;facilitate online trade in goods (e.g. paperless trade);improve the regulatory conditions for telecommunications services by updating the WTO Telecommunications Reference Paper, and;improve market access in services sectors and goods that are key for e-commerce.The EU’s objective in the e-commerce negotiations is to reach an agreement on a comprehensive and ambitious set of WTO rules and obligations, enhancing both domestic and global e-commerce. The EU wants to facilitate business operations, especially those of SMEs, and to strengthen consumer trust in the online environment.The EU also wants the negotiated outcome to be supported by as many WTO Members as possible. It is therefore adopting a flexible negotiating approach that takes into account the different opportunities and challenges that Members may face in relation to e-commerce.More on e-commerce negotiations at the WTOMoratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissionsSince 1998, WTO Members have agreed not to impose customs duties on electronic transmissions – which range from software, emails, and text messages to digital music, movies and videogames.This moratorium is renewed every two years at the WTO Ministerial Conference. The EU is in favour of permanently prohibiting customs duties on electronic transmission, including the transmitted content.The EU considers that it is not in any WTO Member’s interest to retain the right to impose customs duties on electronic transmissions. Such a policy decision would discourage enterprises, and especially SMEs, from engaging in global e-commerce. Customs duties could also increase the cost of business input – and therefore result in higher prices for consumers, market distortions and trade diversion. Many WTO Members have committed in their free trade agreements to ban such customs duties permanently.The EU believes that permanently prohibiting customs duties on electronic transmissions should be part of the negotiated outcome in the WTO e-commerce negotiations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTune in to trade policy insights25 February 2025Episode 11Digital trade is crucial for global business, enabling activities like farming in the Netherlands, accounting in Arizona, and music streaming in South Korea through digital data transfers.

EU trade agreements typically cover trade in services. The EU's objective is to ensure that EU service providers are allowed to supply services in foreign markets and are not discriminated against vis-à-vis national operators or other foreign operators in the same sector.\nProducers and exporters of goods such as textiles, cars or computers, for example, cannot be competitive without access to efficient banking, insurance or accountancy – or to telecommunications and transport systems. The purchase of many products often involves a service component.\nCloud computing allows services such as technical infrastructure, platforms and software to be provided on a global basis. Instead of installing hardware at their customers’ premises, service providers can now offer their services from the cloud remotely – and across borders – demonstrating how services can substitute goods in certain cases.\n\nMore on trade in services and digital trade\nGuide for businesses on trading in services\n\nWhy is it relevant?\n\nThe EU is the world's biggest exporter of manufactured goods, and is a global market leader for high-quality products.\nThe EU economy is already one of the world’s most open to trade: EU import tariffs for industrial products are among the lowest in the world.\nImports from many suppliers of industrial products to the EU enter the bloc at reduced rates under the terms of bilateral agreements or other import duty suspensions, like the Generalised Scheme of Preferences.\nThe services sector contributes more to economic growth and job creation in the EU than any other sector. Services represent some three quarters of the EU’s gross domestic product and two thirds of its employment. The EU is also the world’s biggest exporter of services.\nServices account for over 80% of the EU’s inward foreign direct investment, and for more than 60% of its outward foreign direct investment.\nMutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) facilitate market access by reducing costs and time associated with mandatory product certification.\nThe significance of non-tariff barriers to trade, such as technical barriers to trade or sanitary and phytosanitary measures, has increased considerably, as tariffs steadily decline and governments worldwide introduce more regulatory requirements to address inter alia health, safety or environmental concerns.\nThe way a product is treated on import is linked to its country of origin. Yet globalisation means that many different countries are involved in manufacturing. Determining where goods come from requires clear rules of origin.\n\nEU trade policy on goods and services\nThe EU wants to free up global trade in goods and services through WTO negotiations and through bilateral and regional trade agreements.\nMultilateral and plurilateral negotiations on goods and services:\nCertain WTO members including the EU have joined the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) which provides duty-free access to IT products, including computers, telephones and inputs and components such as semiconductors.\n\nThe ITA has helped to quadruple trade in information technology products.\nSince the ITA was signed in 1996, many products have become obsolete, while new products have emerged. Entire sectors have become digitised, such as medical devices and other sophisticated instruments.\n\nMore information on the ITA and its update\nOn services, the EU is currently participating in two WTO plurilateral negotiations regarding e-commerce and domestic regulation.\n\nE-commerce: Digital technologies have transformed international trade and strongly influence trade policymaking. The EU proposed ambitious digital trade rules in the ongoing plurilateral negotiations on e-commerce in the WTO, which engage more than half of the WTO’s membership. These negotiations remain the EU’s most important strategic objective in the area of digital trade. More information on e-commerce at the WTO.\nDomestic regulation: Barriers to trade in services often take the form of ‘behind the border’ obstacles created through domestic regulatory regimes. The EU is in a group of over 60 WTO members committed to developing disciplines to mitigate the unintended trade-restrictive effects of measures relating to licensing requirements and procedures, qualification requirements and procedures, and technical standards. More information on domestic regulation at the WTO.\n\nBilateral negotiations on goods and services\nA number of the EU's bilateral trade agreements have significantly liberalised trade in goods. Some also include provisions covering non-tariff barriers and trade in services. For example:\n\nThe EU and Mexico's Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement opens up trade in both goods and services.\nThe Association Agreement between the EU and Chile creates a free trade area in goods and services.\nThe EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement eliminates tariffs. The agreement only excludes a limited number of agricultural products from tariff elimination. It also breaks new ground in addressing non-tariff barriers to trade.\nThe EU's trade agreement with Peru and Colombia opens up goods and services markets on both sides.\nThe Association Agreement between the EU and Central America improves access to goods and services markets, and improves conditions for trade through new disciplines on non-tariff barriers.\nThe EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement includes substantial commitments on trade in services, creating opportunities for investment in many service sectors. The deal facilitates access of industrial and agricultural products to this important export market and trade hub in Southeast Asia, through greater recognition of EU standards.\n\nThe way forward on goods and services\nThe EU continues to negotiate ambitious provisions to improve access to goods and services markets with several regions and countries including:\n\nMercosur\nGulf Cooperation Council\nCanada\nIndia\nMorocco\nUkraine\nMoldova\nGeorgia\nArmenia\nMalaysia\nIndonesia\n\nThe EU also concludes Economic Partnership Agreements with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.\nMore on goods and services\n\nThe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is a WTO Agreement that reduces import tariffs on trade in goods around the world.\nThe WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services aims at ensuring increased transparency and predictability of relevant rules and regulations, and promoting progressive liberalisation of international trade in services through successive rounds of negotiation.\nMutual Recognition Agreements newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsPress release27 February 2024New global rules to simplify trade in services enter into force in the WTOTrade in services just got a boost with the entry into force of new World Trade Organization (WTO) rules facilitating and simplifying trade in services.

Existing foreign direct investment stocks held in the rest of the world by investors resident in the EU (outbound investments) amounted to €9,382 billion at the end of 2022. Meanwhile, foreign direct investment stocks held by third country investors in the EU amounted to €7,715 billion at the end of 2022.By contributing to economic growth, job creation and integration in global value chains, foreign investment tends to benefit host countries as well as home countries. Through domestic policies and international agreements, most countries seek to improve conditions to attract investors. Findings by the World Bank also highlight the importance of helping investors retain and expand their existing investments.Objectives of EU investment policyThe EU is one of the most open places to invest in the world. Since 2009 the EU handles foreign direct investment policies on behalf of EU members, as part of the EU common commercial policy. EU investment policy aims to:secure a level playing field so that EU investors abroad are not discriminated or mistreated;make it easier to invest by creating a predictable and transparent business environment;encourage investment that supports sustainable development, respect for human rights and high labour and environmental standards - this includes promoting corporate social responsibility and responsible business practices;attract international investment into the EU, while protecting the EU’s essential interests, and;preserve the right of home and host countries to regulate their economies in the public interest.EU investment negotiationsThe EU is negotiating or implementing investment rules in trade agreements or in self-standing investment agreements. These investment rules cover:allowing the setting up of enterprises by making sure investors can access the market and do not face discrimination between EU and non-EU investors;creating a favourable regulatory framework, both when the investor enters the market and when the investor does economic activities in the country, and;protecting established investments/investors through commitments to non-discrimination, fair treatment for investors or guarantees of compensation in case of expropriation.Investment facilitationThrough investment facilitation, the EU seeks to encourage the setting up of a more transparent, efficient and predictable business climate for investors. This includes, for instance, making information on investment rules public and easily available, or reducing delays in obtaining government permits and approvals.Investment facilitation contributes to unlocking investment opportunities notably for small and medium enterprises. This should also benefit developing countries by making it easier for domestic and foreign investors to invest, conduct their day-to-day business, and expand their existing investments.In the WTO, the EU is contributing to the discussions on investment facilitation.EU proposal – WTO investment facilitation for developmentIn its Trade Policy Review, the European Commission announced its intention to pursue sustainable investment agreements with Africa and the Southern Neighbourhood, focusing on investment facilitation. This initiative is being developed in negotiations for a Sustainable Investment Facilitation Agreement with Angola, and the EPA deepening negotiations with five countries of Eastern and Southern Africa.EU reforms on investment dispute resolutionThe EU agreed in November 2015 on a reformed investment dispute settlement approach to stay up-to-date with the highest standards of legitimacy and transparency. This introduced clearer and more precise rules on investment protection by creating a permanent dispute settlement mechanism called the Investment Court System.This system makes sure that everyone follows the same investment protection rules, and seeks to strike a balance between protecting investors in a transparent manner and safeguarding a state’s right to regulate to pursue public policy objectives.The European Commission promotes further reform of dispute settlement and is leading efforts with trade partners to set up a multilateral investment court to rule on investment disputes.Screening framework for foreign direct investmentOn 19 March 2019, the EU adopted a regulation to create a system to cooperate and exchange information on investments from non-EU countries that may affect security or public order. The regulation makes sure that the EU is better equipped to protect its interests, while remaining among the world’s most open investment areas.More on investment screeningInvestment agreements between EU Member States and non-EU countriesThe EU adopted in 2012 a regulation establishing transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between individual EU Member States and non-EU countries, to make sure that those agreements do not conflict with the EU competences and are consistent with the EU’s investment policy. On 6 April 2020, the Commission submitted a report on the application of the regulation.The regulation allows EU Member States to maintain bilateral investment agreements signed before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, and sets the conditions for EU Member States to modify those agreements, and to negotiate or conclude new ones. Those conditions are:that the agreement is not in conflict with EU law;that the agreement is consistent with the EU’s principles and objectives for external action;that the Commission did not submit (or decide to submit) a recommendation to open EU-wide negotiations with the same third country, and;that the agreement does not create a serious obstacle to the EU negotiating or concluding bilateral investment agreements with non-EU countries.Drawing on the EU's approach to investment protection agreements – and on Member States' best practices – the Commssion has developed Model Clauses to guide Member States in their negotiation (or re-negotiation) of bilateral investment agreements. From March 2020, the Commission publishes its implementing decisions on authorisations granted to individual EU members for bilateral investment agreements.Monitoring and assessment of risks from outbound investmentsConcern is growing regarding foreign direct investments from the EU into third countries (outbound investments). Some investments in a narrow set of critical technologies can come with the risk of EU technology and know-how getting into the hands of non-EU actors, who may use it to undermine international peace and security. This especially concerns technologies suitable for enhancing military and intelligence capabilities. The Commission is taking this reflection further with a White Paper, proposing an in-depth analysis of outbound investments in a narrow set of critical technologies to determine the nature and extent of risks related to such investments and the need for policy responses.On 15 January 2025, the Commission adopted a recommendation to Member States on reviewing outbound investments in technology areas critical for the economic security of the EU. The recommendation builds on the European Economic Security Strategy from June 2023 and the White Paper on Outbound investments from January 2024. It invites Member States to review outbound investments in third countries in semiconductors, artificial intelligence and quantum technologies and to assess, together with the Commission, any potential risks and security concerns related to these investments.\n\n\n\nEU participation in international foraThe EU participates in international institutions and organisations where rules on international investment are discussed:Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD): Investment CommitteeUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD): World Investment ForumWorld Trade Organization (WTO): Committee on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs), Structured discussions on investment facilitation for developmentUnited Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL): Working Group III on Investor-State Dispute Settlement ReformInternational Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)Energy Charter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsPress release15 January 2025Commission calls on Member States to review outbound investments and assess risks to economic securityThe Commission has today published a Recommendation calling on EU Member States to review outbound investments of their companies into non-EU countries.

In the EU, in 2017, the public purchase of goods and services was estimated to be worth some €2 trillion or 13.3% of GDP (Source: European Commission, public procurement indicators, 2017).The EU put new rules in place to open up the public procurement market within Europe in 2016. These new rules reduce red tape and make it easier for smaller companies to do business with public authorities.Opening public procurement markets can be beneficial for many reasons:Competition between private companies increases a government's chances of getting better value for money and makes the use of public resources more efficient.Making the application process more transparent helps to fight corrupt practices.It increases legal certainty.The EU public procurement market is one of the most open in the world. However, European businesses cannot always get equal access to public procurement markets outside the EU. Many countries are reluctant to open their public procurement markets to international competition. This creates an uneven playing field for EU companies and limits business opportunities in these markets.Some countries have introduced protectionist measures relating to procurement contracts, which hit EU companies. Such policies are applied by:Brazil;China;India;IndonesiaRussia;Turkey, and;the United States (among others).EU trade policy and public procurementAlongside regulating the EU's internal public procurement market, the EU also wants to see more open public procurement markets outside the EU.In its trade deals, the EU and its trading partners offer each other access to procurement by certain public authorities and bodies for certain goods and services to encourage more open and balanced international markets. This means that EU companies can do business in the international public procurement market more easily, thus growing their business and providing more jobs.Trade talks with other countries and regions:Rules about public procurement have already been included in EU free trade agreements (FTAs) with:Andean CommunityArmeniaCanadaCentral AmericaChileGeorgiaIraqKazakhstan, see also Central AsiaKyrgyzstan, see Central AsiaMercosurMexicoMoldovaSingaporeSouth KoreaSwitzerlandUkraineVietnamNegotiations are ongoing with several regions and countries and are expected to open public procurement markets:AustraliaAzerbaijanIndonesiaNew ZealandTunisiaUzbekistan, see Central AsiaThe International Procurement Instrument\n\n\n\nThe Regulation for an International Procurement Instrument (IPI) to improve reciprocal access to international procurement markets was published on 30 June 2022 and entered into force on 29 August 2022. The IPI gives the EU greater leverage to get access to public procurement markets outside the EU, boosting opportunities for EU companies.The EU public procurement market is one of the largest and most accessible in the world. However, many of the EU's major trading partners apply restrictive practices in their markets that discriminate against EU businesses. These restrictions affect competitive EU sectors such as construction, public transport, medical devices, power generation and pharmaceuticals. The IPI will help address such procurement barriers abroad by empowering the EU to:initiate investigations against alleged restrictions in third-country procurement markets;engage in consultations with the country concerned on the opening of its procurement market, and;if consultations fail to provide a satisfactory outcome, restrict access to the EU procurement market for foreign companies originating in the countries that continue to apply restrictions against EU companies. More information on IPIHow to lodge a complaintIPI investigationsGreen public procurementWith green public procurement, public authorities seek to procure goods, services and works that have a reduced impact on the environment throughout the lifecycle of these goods, services and works. The EU and the United States have issued a Joint EU-US Catalogue of Best Practices on Green Public Procurement. The Joint EU-US Catalogue presents the policies, practices and actions used in all stages of the procurement process, from strategic planning and pre-procurement to procurement and the post-contract award stage. It addresses environmental and climate challenges, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy efficiency, or promoting circular economy approaches. It serves as inspiration for policymakers and suppliers globally, and provides ideas for the uptake of green solutions in public procurement worldwide.Revision of global trade rulesThe revision of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) entered into force in 2014. It provides a higher level of clarity and transparency and guarantees equal footing to suppliers, supplies and services originating in GPA Parties in procurement procedures. It also offered some €80-100 billion a year of additional business opportunities by further opening up public procurement markets in the 48 countries that are part of the agreement.There are currently 21 WTO Members that are Parties to the GPA, including the European Union and its member states counting as one Party.More on public procurementRegulation on access to international public procurement marketsThe International Procurement Instrument (IPI): Promoting a level playing field around the world (31 March 2023)WTO Government Procurement Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsPress release14 January 2025Commission to assess next steps for tackling discrimination in China's public procurement market for medical devicesA report published today, highlighting continued discrimination against EU medical devices in China's public procurement market, will inform the Commission's assessment on what measures should be taken to restore the EU-China level playing field in this area.1 min readNews article20 June 2024Commission launches new public procurement portal  The new tool serves as a public procurement knowledge hub, with easy-to-access information on the rules governing public procurement for contracting entities in EU Member States.1 min readPress release24 April 2024Commission launches first investigation under EU International Procurement InstrumentToday, the European Commission has initiated for the first time an investigation under the International Procurement Instrument (IPI).1 min readSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest eventsPartner meetingsCivil Society Dialogue on the International Procurement InstrumentTuesday 27 February 2024, 14:30 - 16:30 (CET)Online onlyLive streaming availableSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In concrete terms, the European Commission developed a fully-fledged strategy for raw materials, which was outlined in the 2008 Communication entitled the Raw Materials Initiative. This was revised in February 2011 in a Communication, which further boosted the integration of raw material priorities in EU policies.EU trade policy is actively committed to ensuring that international raw materials markets operate in a free and transparent manner. For this purpose, the EU’s trade strategy relies on three pillars:Defining the rules of the game through bilateral and multilateral negotiations;Enforcing the rules and tackling market barriers when required, and;Promoting the debate on raw materials, both in bilateral and multilateral settings.The EU is working with a diverse range of international partners to support and accelerate critical minerals projects and to promote policies that strengthen supply chains of critical minerals via the Minerals Security Partnership Forum.Results on raw materialsEU-Korea FTA includes the prohibition of duties, taxes or other fees on exportation.EU-Singapore FTA includes the prohibition of duties, taxes or measures of an equivalent effect on exportation.EU-Central America, and EU-Colombia/Peru trade agreements include the prohibition of export duties or taxes, with some minor exceptions.WTO accession of Tajikistan: a commitment was secured on the prohibition of export duties or taxes, except for a list of products with bound rates.WTO raw materials’ cases against China: successful conclusion of the first WTO case against China’s export restrictions on nine raw materials (bauxite, coke, fluorspar, magnesium, manganese, silicon carbide, silicon metal, yellow phosphorus and zinc) which were found in violation of WTO rules and of China’s commitments; a second case was launched in 2012 against export restrictions applied by China on another set of products (rare earths, tungsten and molybdenum).More on raw materialsDG Enterprise and Industry's webpage: Raw Materials – International AspectsMinerals Security Partnership Forum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTune in to trade policy insights19 December 2024Episode 10Tom Moylan meets the new Trade and Economic Security Commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, to discuss Mercosur, tariffs, and trust.19/12/2024 | Episode 10 | 29 minutes14 November 2024Episode 9Do you care about where our goods come from?

The regulation contributes to the goals of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) with regard to trade in nuclear material and to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.The regulation is directly applicable throughout the EU. EU countries nevertheless need to take national measures to implement some of its provisions, e.g. enforcement and penalties.Overview of national measures Dual-use export authorisationsThere are four types of export authorisations in place in the EU export control regime.EU General Export Authorisations (EUGEAs):EU General Export Authorisations (EUGEAs) allow exports of dual-use items to certain destinations under certain conditions (see Annex II of the Regulation). Regulation (EU) 2021/821 provides for the following EUGEAs:exports to Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, the United Kingdom and the United States of America;export of certain dual-use items to certain destinations;export after repair/replacement;temporary export for exhibitions or fairs;telecommunications;chemicals;intra-group technology transfers, and;encryption.National General Export Authorisations (NGEAs):National General Export Authorisations (NGEAs) may be issued by EU Member States if they are consistent with existing EUGEAs and do not refer to items listed in Annex IIg of the Regulation.Global licenses:Global licenses can be granted by competent authorities to one exporter and may cover multiple items to multiple countries of destination or end users.Individual licenses:Individual licenses can be granted by competent authorities to one exporter and cover exports of one or more dual-use items to one end-user or consignee in a third country.Modernisation of the EU export control regimeExport controls need to be regularly updated to adjust to evolving security risks and threats, rapid developments in science and technology, and changes in world trade.Following a 2014 communication that set out options to review the EU's export controls, the Commission adopted a proposal to modernise the EU export control system in September 2016. On 20 May 2021, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation (EU) 2021/821.The new Export Control Regulation upgrades and strengthens the EU's export control toolbox to respond effectively to evolving security risks and emerging technologies, and allows the EU to effectively protect its interests and values.The Commission regularly holds public consultations, and has a constant dialogue with industry, academia and civil society, in an effort to strike the right balance between security and trade.On 24 January 2024, the Commission published a White Paper on Export Controls outlining how to make EU export controls more effective in the context of growing geopolitical tensions, with a view to better upholding international security and safeguarding the EU's security interests.Stakeholder consultation and outreachExport restrictions (sanctions) on dual-use and sensitive technologyIn certain cases, additional EU restrictive measures (’sanctions’) may apply to dual-use exports. EU restrictive measures on exports of sensitive technologiesFrequently asked questions concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia's actions destabilising the situation in UkraineList of High Priority Battlefield Items (February 2024)Preventing Russian export control and sanctions evasion: Updated G7 guidance for industryUpdated guidance for industry, agreed on 24 September by G7 members Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States - along with the European Commission - assists industry in identifying Russian evasion practices, to protect G7 technology from misappropriation, prevent reputational harm, and mitigate liability risk while supporting continued success of export controls and sanctions.More information on dual-use export controlsRegulation 2023/2616 amending Regulation 2021/821 regarding the list of dual-use items (europa.eu) (September 2023)Regulation 2021-821 for the control of exports of dual-use items (including the updated EU control list of dual-use items)Annual export control reportsGuidanceConsultation on the White Paper on Dual-Use Export Controls (2 February-30 April 2024)Dual-use export control: National competent authorities (February 2022 update)Compilation of national control listsDual-use correlation tableReplies to the public consultation on cyber-surveillance guidance (July 2023)EU Export Control Handbook for Chemicals (2023 edition)Other useful links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest newsNews article31 January 2025Report highlights EU’s approach to export controls of dual-use itemsA European Commission report assessing patterns of Member-State exports of dual-use items shows that both authorisations and denials for the export of those most sensitive goods is on the rise as compared to 2021.1 min readNews article16 October 2024Commission publishes guidelines for cyber-surveillance exporters Today, the Commission published guidelines on the export of cyber-surveillance items, aiming to raise awareness of the risks associated with misuse of cyber-surveillance technologies and provide exporters with practical tools to evaluate human rights concerns.1 min readNews article1 October 20242024 Update of the EU Control List of Dual-Use ItemsOn 5 September 2024, the European Commission adopted a Delegated Regulation updating the EU dual-use export control list in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2021/821.1 min readSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest eventsPartner meetings4th Joint EU-US stakeholders outreach event Re-export of dual-use itemsWednesday 19 July 2023, 15:00 - 17:00 (CEST)Online onlyLive streaming availableConferences and summits2022 Export Control ForumTuesday 6 December 2022, 09:30 - 17:00 (CET)Live streaming availablePartner meetings2nd Joint EU-US Stakeholder Outreach on Dual Use Export ControlsTuesday 19 July 2022, 16:00 - 18:00 (CEST)Online onlyLive streaming availableSee all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Therefore the Commission is proposing to revise the Waste Shipment Regulation.\nTrade in waste in a nutshell\n\nNon-hazardous waste contains valuable secondary raw materials. As natural resources are scarce, the importance of these materials is growing. Waste has become a major trading good.\nThe OECD has established a control mechanism for trade in waste among OECD countries. The EU also regulates exports of non-hazardous waste for recovery to countries outside the OECD, to help these countries ensure that they import only the waste they have agreed to, and that it is managed in an environmentally sustainable way.\n\nEU trade policy and waste shipment\nRegulation (EC) 1418/2007 sets out the control procedures for the export of non-hazardous waste for recovery (recycling) from the EU to non-OECD countries. The Regulation was established on the basis of information received from countries of destination about their control procedures for the import of non-hazardous wastes.\nThe latest update was made through Regulation (EU) 2021/1840. It was adopted on 20 October 2021 and entered into force on 10 November 2021.\nMore information about Waste Shipment Regulations\nMore on Trade in waste\n\nThe 'mother' regulation (Regulation 1013/2006) and its amendments\nHow to export for recovery non-hazardous waste to certain non-OECD countries (Regulation 1418/2007 and its amendments)\nBasel Convention on the control of cross-border movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal\nOECD Decision on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Wastes Destined for Recovery Operations\n\nTrade in waste in other Commission departments\n\nEU Environment website on waste\nEU Environment website on waste shipments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Share this page\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade and Economic SecurityThis site is managed by:Directorate-General for Trade and Economic SecurityAccessibilityContact usContacts and enquiriesEU Trade Newsletter - SubscribeEU Trade Newsletter - Manage account/UnsubscribeFollow usJoin us on LinkedInTrade-Off podcast#EUtradeAbout usMaking trade policyNewsDirectorate-General for Trade and Economic Security - Organisation, forecasts and achievementsSitemapRelated sitesBusiness, Economy, EuroContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResourcesReport an IT vulnerabilityLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Building on the Impact Assessment, the SIA consists of chapters examining specific subjects in greater depth. SIA chapters cover topics where the agreement is most likely to have an impact on sustainability issues, or where the agreement opens opportunities for achieving non-trade policy objectives.\nThese assessments are an opportunity for stakeholders in both the EU and in the partner countries to share their views with negotiators.\nSIAs have several purposes, including:\n\nfeeding information into and helping steer the negotiations;\nassessing the changes that are likely to be caused by a trade agreement;\nhelping to identify possible trade-offs, and;\nensuring that the related policy choices are optimised.\n\nSIAs contribute to sound, evidence-based and transparent trade negotiations.\nFrom this page you can access all the SIA reports ever published and the respective Commission position paper in response to the SIA. You can also learn more about the methodological framework for SIAs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are the assessments carried out?\n\nSIAs are independent assessments produced by external consultants and take place during trade negotiations.\nBuilding on the Impact Assessments (IA), the SIA consists of additional in-depth studies prepared in parallel with consultation activities. The SIA goes deeper into specific topics than what is possible to achieve in the IA. It examines in detail the impacts of the agreement on specific themes or sectors, and provides negotiators with actionable recommendations based on a thorough review of the evidence.\nReports are released in draft form for feedback from stakeholders before being finalised. The Commission then prepares a position paper to give its views on the final report and explain how the SIA conclusions have or will influence negotiations.\nSustainability Impact Assessment handbook\nThe European Commission published a second edition of the handbook for sustainability impact assessment in 2016. It sets out the main characteristics, objectives and principles of the new generation of SIAs.\nThe handbook should be used alongside the Guidelines on the analysis of human rights impact in impact assessments of trade-related policy initiatives and the Better Regulation Guidelines.\nIf you have a general enquiry about SIAs, please contact us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOngoing assessments\n\nThere are currently no documents available for this section. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleted assessments \n\nEU-India FTA and IPA\nSIA in Support of Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement negotiations between the European Union and the Republic of India\nMore information about the EU-India SIA and how to contribute to it\nPosition paper\n\nPosition Paper - November 2023\n\nReports\n\nFinal Report, Case Studies and Annex - December 2023\n\n\t\nExecutive Summary (other languages) - December 2023\n\n\nDraft Final Report, Case Studies and Annex - October 2023\n\t\nDraft Executive Summary - October 2023\n\n\nInception Report and Annex - April 2023\n\t\nExecutive Summary (other languages)\n\n\n\nTerms of Reference - August 2022\nEU-Eastern and Southern Africa - Deepening of the EPA\nSIA in Support of Negotiations with Partner Countries in Eastern and Southern Africa in view of Deepening the Existing Interim Economic Partnership Agreement\nMore information about the EU-Eastern and Southern Africa SIA and how to contribute to it\nPosition paper\n\nPosition Paper – February 2023\n\nReports\n\nFinal report – July 2022\n\n\t\nExecutive Summary (other languages)\n\n\nEx-post Evaluation Report – May 2021\nInception report - October 2020\n\nTerms of Reference - December 2019\nEU-SADC EPA - Angola's accession\nSIA in support of negotiations with Angola in view of Angola’s accession to the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and South African Development Community.\nPosition paper\n\nPosition Paper – March 2023\n\nReports\n\nFinal report – December 2021\n\n\t\nExecutive Summary (other languages)\n\n\nInception report - May 2021\n\t\nExecutive Summary - May 2021\n\n\n\nTerms of Reference - January 2021\nEU-Philippines and EU-Malaysia free trade agreement negotiations\nSIAs in support of free trade agreements (FTA) negotiations between the European Union and the Republic of the Philippines and between the European Union and Malaysia\nThese SIA final reports are published in line with DG TRADE’s commitment to transparency in its policy evaluation practices. However, since negotiations on a FTA between the EU and Malaysia as well as the Philippines have been on hold for several years, at this stage it would be premature for the Commission services to
